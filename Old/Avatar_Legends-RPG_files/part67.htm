<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This chapter presented all the different core mechanics of the game, from basic moves to balance moves to combat exchanges, as if they are disparate, separate elements. But whether you’re running or playing <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, what you’re doing in your game is weaving everything together into one coherent tapestry, one ongoing conversation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While you’re playing, you and the other players just talk about what you do and think and say, until a move is triggered; that move then resolves, players make necessary choices and the GM connects it all together, and the game picks up again. If you get into a fight, you may go into a combat exchange to resolve</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a series of blows back and forth, and then immediately go right into one of the balance moves as your PC cries out to their op- ponent to stop fighting. Everything connects into a whole, and all of the tools are, to some extent, available all together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re a player, it’s your job to help weave it all together by continuing to think as your character, to describe what they do, how they react, and so on. You can always choose to angle toward a move of some kind, trying to trigger it specifically—</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and you can even call out to the GM that you’re trying to trigger it—but you always have to include the framing of your charac- ter’s actions in the fiction. If you focus on what your character does and thinks and says, then you’ll help create the connective tissue to tie the whole game together. You won’t flow from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">one combat exchange into another just because that’s what’s “supposed” to happen; instead, you might make another move that makes more sense for what your character is doing in the moment, or you might go into a new combat exchange because that’s what your character chooses. The more you emphasize the things your character says, does, and thinks, the more you’ll help connect the whole game into one coherent story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re the GM, it’s your job to help weave it all together by filling in the gaps between the moves and mechanics. When the conversation of the game flows into a basic move and then back into the normal conversation and fiction, the GM helps to bring all the mechanical results of the move back into something in the story. For example, a character marking 1-fatigue appears tired or breathless, or a character marking Angry shows it on their face, and so on. Sometimes that means asking questions of the PCs to help go from the mechanics of the move back to what’s actually happening in the fiction; sometimes that means just saying what happens, especially on a miss. In combat exchanges, the GM helps to string together the disparate techniques and approaches into an actual scene in the fiction, with characters moving around, speaking to each other, acting and responding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">In every case, the key to weaving the game together, to mak-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing it more than just the sum of its parts, is to make as much as possible exist within the fiction itself. The game mechanics refer to the in-fiction world—they’re never just numbers on a page!</p>
