<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where’s the Bending Move?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There is no one “bending” move—bending (or an action using non-bending training) happens with a move, not because of it. Moves instead focus on your character’s intent. In game terms, whether you sling a rock near a guard to get them to leave</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">their post or use airbending to throw your voice and taunt them away, you’re <b>tricking </b>them. You might <b>guide and comfort </b>someone by saying kind things to them, or you might create a gentle fire that warms the two of you as you huddle in the night air. If you use bending in some way that doesn’t match up easily with any of the other moves, it’s most likely <b>relying on your skills and training</b>, but even then you might end up <b>pushing your luck </b>if it’s particularly risky or uncertain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Your background also determines what kinds of informa- tion you can obtain—an Outlaw PC can identify and decipher thieves’ signature graffiti, a Monastic PC can identify the signif- icance of religious iconography, and so on. Whenever you want to learn something beyond the scope of <span class="s8">assessing a situation</span>, you can <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>if it’s in your wheelhouse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, you can try to perform a familiar custom. This aspect of <span class="s8">relying on your skills and training </span>is most often about social ac- tions (like fitting in somewhere) but it also covers specific rites, rituals, and practices based on your training or background. A Privileged PC from a noble family can try to infiltrate an illicit auction by knowing the right things to say, while another PC with a reclusive Monastic background might need to <span class="s8">push their luck </span>to blend in. A PC with the Wilderness background from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Southern Water Tribe could <span class="s8">rely on their skills and training </span>to undertake the ice-dodging rite of passage, steering their boat through danger to prove they’ve come of age. If you’re attempt- ing to bypass an obstacle or navigate a situation that you’ve experienced before as part of your background or training, it’s probably a familiar custom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Because this move covers so many different things, it can be tempting to use it for everything, so make sure you’re not trig- gering a different move instead. Generally, if any other move fits better, use that one. If you’re generally looking over a besieged area to see what’s useful, what’s in danger, and so on, you’re <span class="s8">assessing a situation </span>even if you have a background as a siege engineer. But if you use that Military background as a siege engi- neer to specifically locate structural weak points for demolition (gaining new insight), you’re <span class="s8">relying on your skills and training </span>rather than <span class="s8">assessing a situation</span>. The GM makes the final call on which move is appropriate.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s21">Options for Relying on Your Skills &amp; Training </span>Unlike when you <span class="s8">push your luck</span>, the consequences for rolling a 7–9 (and even a miss) on this move aren’t as harsh. You have more control over your approach because of your experience, and you’re capable of dealing with complications as they arise. On a 7–9,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you accomplish your goal but not quite in the way you wanted or intended—the GM tells you how your action <i>might </i>lead to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unexpected consequences. This information is for you, the player, so you can decide if you want to let this happen or not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to accept those consequences, your character might know what’s coming or they could be totally caught off- guard. By choosing to mark fatigue instead, your character sees that complication as or just before it happens and manages to straighten themselves out before it makes things worse. When you mark fatigue, describe how you compensate for your less- than-perfect attempt or otherwise push through.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quartz the Guardian wants to warn the local Earth Kingdom military forces about an impending Fire Nation ambush, but Quartz has a Military background—he knows that it’s not going to be the easiest thing in the world to reach the right ears. “Can I use my knowledge of the military to find someone at the right rank and position who’d listen to me, and who can actually do something with that advice?” asks Quinn.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Sure,” the GM says. “But first you have to find the officer; you’ll have to figure out a way to persuade them once you’ve found them. Roll to <b>rely on your skills and training.</b>”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quinn nods and rolls, getting a 9. “So I think that this means you’re going to be noticed as you go around the camp,” says the GM. “You are drawing the attention of people in the military camp who think you’re suspicious—they won’t intervene before you talk to someone, but they might make it tough to get out of here. Unless you mark fatigue to avoid notice.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oof, I don’t have much fatigue to mark,” says Quinn. “I’ll just let them spy me.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Great,” says the GM. “So you find a lieutenant, her uniform is just the right degree of muddy and torn, her face just the right amount of hardened but open, that you think she’s one of</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">those officers who’s reasonable, and who’s well-liked enough to command respect. What do you do?”</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">“I’m the Prodigy!&quot; says Ruhan. &quot;I’m the best archer in the world!” The GM considers the situation—Ruhan has a point. “That’s fair. Because this is your jam—archery—and the train is stationary, and you’re not in any dire condition right now, just standing firmly on a</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">rooftop, let’s just make it a <b>rely on your skills and training.</b>”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ruhan rolls and gets an 8. “I think this is about how much control you have over exactly what you hit with your arrow— whether you just smash the controls so no one can even start the train, or whether you break the controls so no one can oper- ate them, but wind up locking them into full throttle.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, man, I definitely don’t want to make this into a rocket train. I mark the fatigue,” says Ruhan.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Excellent! So you break the controls!”</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Faking illness to draw a guard into your prison cell, dressing up as a dark spirit to scare intruders away, convincing a ship captain to give you passage with forged papers—any time you use your wits and skills to fool, confuse, or deceive NPCs, you’re <span class="s8">tricking an NPC</span>. This move covers all sorts of deception, from bald-faced lies to creating diversions. Whether you’re bluffing your way into or out of somewhere, fooling or distracting someone, or otherwise convincing an NPC of a falsehood for some reason, it’s a <span class="s8">trick</span>. If you just lie without any intent to push the NPC to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">action, though, you’re not <span class="s8">tricking</span>. And if you lie in a particularly ridiculous, completely incredible way—the NPC has to be a fool to fall for it—then you’re probably <span class="s8">pushing your luck</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you trigger this move, first tell the GM what you’re trying to get the NPC to do. If you’re not trying to get them to do something right this second, then you’re not <span class="s8">tricking </span>them yet. On a hit, they take the bait and do what you want, but only for a short while. You then get to choose <i>how </i>they fall for your trickery—they might be briefly thrown off or flustered, make a mistake you can capitalize on, or buy it hook, line, and sinker. A roll of 7–9 lets you choose one of these options, while a particu- larly effective trick on a 10+ lets you choose two instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Missing on a <span class="s8">trick </span>attempt can result in a lot of different results. The most obvious outcome is that your target catches you in your lie or discovers your deception. They might just as easily go along with it but reveal a new complication about the situation in the process. They might even believe your trickery in a way that brings too much attention to you—not only do you convince the opera house staff that you’re filling in for a sick performer, but they tell you you’re about to miss your cue and shove you on stage!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Options for Tricking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they stumble,” </i>the NPC believes your deception and it catches them off guard. When you next make a move against them based on your trickery, you take +1 to the roll. If you don’t choose this option, they buy your trick but you can’t continue to use it as leverage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they act foolishly,” </i>they fall for your trick in a way that also creates another opening for you to take advantage of. They might reveal something hidden, falsely assume something else that benefits you, or otherwise give you a chance to act. Whatever it is, it’s only a momentary opening and you still need to act quick- ly to seize it. If you don’t choose this option, your trick grants the original opportunity without any extra openings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they overcommit,” </i>not only do they take the bait but you sell it so well that it takes a long time for them to realize they’ve been fleeced. If you don’t choose this option, your trick deceives them but they catch on sooner rather than later to your trickery.</p>

Is that a <b>rely on skills and training </b>with my Criminal background? Playing dice games, playing someone?” asks Kirilaq’s player, Kayla.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“No, I think it’s a <b>trick</b>,” says the GM. “Your skills and training let you <b>trick </b>like this, but <b>trick </b>is more specific and more direct, and it matches the whole thing that you’re doing.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Kayla agrees and rolls, getting a 10! “I definitely want them to overcommit—I don’t want them to figure this out for a while— and…I think I want them to act foolishly, too.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Excellent,” says the GM. “So they’re really into this, enjoying beating you—but of course, only by the skin of their teeth, you make sure, to keep the tension—and they start openly talking about all manner of things, including the crates and how they think dragon eggs are inside, and where exactly the eggs are going to be stored. They even imply the lock is special, how no one can get in without a special tool, and one guard shows you a weird flute in his tunic.”</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Airbending wind into the sails as your companion steers your ship through jagged rocks, splitting up to look for clues in an abandoned temple, putting on a dramatic performance to help sell your companion’s con—any time you step in and assist another PC’s actions, you are <span class="s8">helping a companion</span>. This can help them succeed by either improving their roll from a 6 (a miss) to a 7, or a 9 to 10!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In order to <span class="s8">help a companion</span>, you must provide assistance somehow, and you must mark fatigue. It’s not enough to say, “I’m helping” and mark fatigue—you need to explain how you’re helping your companion succeed! If they’re repairing a sabotaged Satomobile mid-race, for example, yelling advice at them from across the crowded racetrack isn’t going to cut it. If you can’t think of a way to help or you can’t mark fatigue, your character is either out of ideas at the moment or tapped out and can’t <span class="s8">help </span>another PC.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">As mentioned before, <span class="s8">helping a companion </span>can only increase their roll by 1. If your help doesn’t bring your companion up</p>

You also can’t <span class="s8">help </span>more than once for the same ally’s move, even if you have the fatigue to burn. However, you can still count on the rest of your companions—multiple allies can <span class="s8">help </span>with the same move! To do so, everyone providing aid to that PC’s roll must describe how they assist in the moment and must spend 1-fatigue each.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can <span class="s8">help a companion </span>on most moves <i>except </i>the <span class="s8">stance move </span>in combat exchanges. (For more on the <span class="s8">stance move</span>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;You can, if you can do something to actually help,&quot; says the GM. &quot;What do you do or say?&quot;</p>

You&#39;re a bit busy, so you probably can&#39;t help now, not without losing concentration on what you&#39;re doing,&quot; says the GM. &quot;So it stands as a miss, and here&#39;s what happens next…&quot;</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Cool! Mark 1-fatigue. That&#39;ll give Iris a +1 and make that roll a 10!&quot; says the GM.</p>
