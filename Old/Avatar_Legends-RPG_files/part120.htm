<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The contents of this adventure create a sandbox for your PCs, a setting in which they can choose any path they’d like to move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the story forward. Here are some of the tools you can find in the adventure to help guide them:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Summary” provides an outline of the adventure and explains the various issues at stake in finding Rose. It includes the motivations for various NPCs and NPC factions for kidnapping Rose, along</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">with clues about how to implicate them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Introduction” brings the PCs into the story and sets up your group to undertake the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Escalations” spotlights additional events you can use to amp up the tension in Ba Sing Se and to help drive the action in your game forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Characters &amp; Groups” provides the backstories of NPCs and their stats for use in your game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Locations” features different areas for the PCs to explore during the adventure and explains where important characters and clues might be found.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “GM Advice” contains additional guidance for this adventure just for the GM, including advice on how to use this adventure in other eras.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you run the adventure, it’s a good idea to read it in full, paying close attention to the Summary and the Introduction. Once you start playing, however, you may find the Escalations, Important Characters &amp; Groups, and Important Locations to be the most useful tools as your players jump into the story.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are used to running adventures with heavily detailed encounters and prepared NPCs, it might surprise you to find few mechanics written into this adventure, beyond the escalations and some information about various characters. <span class="s10">Avatar Legends:</span>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roleplaying Game <span class="p">relies on players triggering moves based on the actions they take during play instead of asking players to make any specific checks for specific actions required by the</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adventure. You can read more about how these moves shape play in <span class="s20">Chapter 3: Fundamentals of Play</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since every significant action a PC takes drives the action of the game forward, <span class="s20">there is also no prescribed order of events</span>. Instead, the adventure starts the PCs in a dramatic situation that demands immediate action from the heroes! It’s your job to use the material in this adventure to keep things moving, providing interesting events and NPCs to consistently engage your players. The story emerges as the players make decisions about what they want to do in the face of those obstacles and challenges.
