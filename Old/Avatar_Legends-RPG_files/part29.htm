<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Hundred Year War Era details the state of the world just before the start of the <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>show. The Hundred Year War is the most tragic time in the world’s known history. The Four Nations are divided like never before, and balance and harmony are little more than distant memories.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The starkest representation of this divide is the loss of the Air Nomads to genocide, with the exception of Avatar Aang, who has disappeared. The world had to do without an Avatar for the entirety of the war, and most people living today weren’t alive during a time with an active Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The war began when Fire Lord Sozin and the <span class="s20">Fire Nation </span>
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark54" class="s22">military took advantage of the Great Comet, now known as Soz- in’s Comet, as it passed by the planet and temporarily increased all firebending abilities across the world. With this power, Sozin conducted the Air Nomad Genocide (page 58),</a> the war’s horrifying opening salvo designed to kill the Avatar and instill fear in the people of other nations. Though Avatar Aang survived by entering the Avatar State and freezing himself in an iceberg, as far as the world knew, he vanished. Fire Lord Sozin and his son Azulon continued the war by invading, raiding, and colo- nizing the other surviving nations. The current Fire Lord and son of Azulon, Ozai, bears the same agenda as his predecessors: to weaken and attack every city and settlement until the entire world belongs to the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Water Tribes </span>are completely disconnected from one another, as they have been ever since about 50 years after the war began. The Northern Water Tribe keeps behind their walled city of Agna Qel’a, which successfully fends off all attempts at invasion, while the Southern Water Tribe hangs on by a thread. Only a handful of years ago, the Fire Nation raided Southern Water Tribe settlements with the goal of killing or capturing all Waterbenders in the South. While the warriors from the South- ern Water Tribe left to take the fight to the Fire Nation, those who remain work to keep each other safe and their tribe alive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though the walls of Ba Sing Se keep its citizens safe from invasion, the Fire Nation has a firm grasp on many rural <span class="s20">Earth Kingdom </span>
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark42" class="s22">areas. Some Fire Nation colonies in the Earth King- dom date back to Avatar Roku’s time (page 44),</a> and the Fire Nation established many more throughout the war. Political corruption in Ba Sing Se is rampant, with a secret police force</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">known as the Dai Li brainwashing citizens to maintain the facade that there is no war.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In some parts of the world, life struggles onward in an uneasy normalcy, but the war rages on and the Fire Nation spreads across the globe. Safety is an illusion; those who live in vulnera- ble areas are forced to make sacrifices in order to survive, push- ing many to their limits. History is at a turning point, and while the prospects are grim, some still fight for a better future.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">A World Without an Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As far as the world is concerned, there is no Avatar. There are theories and rumors, but for nearly a full century the world has existed without the Avatar’s influence. There is no Avatar to keep the Fire Nation in check, and Ozai and his supporters aim to keep it that way. To ensure their dominance they hunt for the missing Avatar, who they presume is a very old man by this point—if he’s even alive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As for the other nations, many have abandoned hope in the idea of the Avatar returning to restore balance to the world. King Bumi, the ruler of Omashu, is the only living person who was friends with Avatar Aang before his disappearance. For everyone else, the Avatar is steadily becoming nothing more than a legend.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hundred Year War Era Significant Themes</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Brutality of War</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark58" class="s25">The war affects nearly everyone in some way and defines many people’s lives. With catastrophic losses, it’s no surprise that many people are traumatized. Many have lost loved ones in the war, like Jet (page 63),</a> the leader of the Freedom Fighters in the Earth Kingdom, who lost his parents. Violence and destruction do not affect everyone in the same way, and some may butt heads over their different ways of coping. A more solemn and respectful per- son might take issue with another who contends with the trage- dies of war by making jokes and not taking anything seriously.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Present a desperate situation</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Push an NPC to their limit</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Take from someone who has nothing</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Survival and Secrets</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Many people don’t have the luxury of focusing on much other than survival, and often the key to survival is to hide the truth. For example, when the Fire Nation launched raids against the Southern Water Tribe, they hunted down every last Waterbend- er they could find. The very few who weren’t caught only sur- vived because they and their loved ones lied about their bending abilities. Stories like that abound in myriad forms, from Earth Kingdom villages functionally starved by tyrannical Fire Nation governors to Waterbenders driven into hiding or to terrible extremes in order to save themselves.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Lie, cheat, and steal for survival</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Hide the truth for the right reasons</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Mistrust outsiders on principle</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Morals Being Tested</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">It isn’t always easy to choose between right and wrong, espe- cially if your life is at stake. Fire Nation citizens may question their nation’s choices and their participation in them, but fear betraying their leaders at the risk of putting their loved ones in danger. Those who suffer may question how far is too far for survival or revenge. Some may have no problem sacrificing the lives of innocents if it saves more innocent lives in the long run, while others may not even be able to bring themselves to harm someone responsible for the deaths of many.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Push a PC’s principle to the breaking point</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Present a tempting solution with harsh consequences</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Destroy something to protect an NPC’s loved ones</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colonization in Progress</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Throughout the war, Fire Nation colonists seized parts of the Earth Kingdom and emptied Air Nomad lands. Some regions have been home to both Earth Kingdom locals and Fire Nation colonists for generations, while other areas are freshly colo- nized. Though some Earth Kingdom citizens have adapted to living side by side with their colonizers, others can’t abide by it. Earth Kingdom citizens living in these settlements may try to fight back while others may insist on pacifism in hopes of preventing further bloodshed.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Attack with Fire Nation soldiers</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Present powerful figures torn by conflicting loyalties</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Threaten or destroy a unique cultural item or practice</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hope in Rebellion</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">In the midst of war and despair, some people choose to keep hope alive and fight back no matter what it takes. Oppression thrives where people have lost hope in resistance. Communities and individuals who aren’t ready to surrender have a hard battle in front of them, but hope has a way of inspiring communities to join the good fight. People who hold onto their dreams of a better future are an integral part of this era and a major key to ending the war.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Rebel against unjust rule</p>

<a name="bookmark54">Important Events</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is a list of important events, which occur leading up to and during this era. Each event has a list of the current consequences for stories in this era.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Disappearance of Avatar Aang</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nearly a century ago just before the Fire Nation attacked, Avatar Aang disappeared after running away with his sky bison, Appa. Struggling with his identity as the Avatar and upset over the news that he had to leave the Southern Air Temple to begin his official training, Aang ran off only to be caught in a storm. To survive, he involuntarily entered the Avatar state and froze him- self and Appa in an iceberg, where he still remains. No one in the world (except for rare individuals, such as King Bumi) knows what happened to the Avatar, what his name was, or what he looked like, only that the Avatar disappeared. Some, like Prince Zuko, believe he is an old man, but others believe the Avatar’s reincarnation cycle simply came to an end.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• There is no Avatar.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Most people don’t believe the Avatar will come back.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The world has lost more of its connection with the Spirit World.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomad Genocide</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not long after the Avatar’s disappearance, the Fire Nation attacked the other three nations with overwhelming force. When Sozin’s Comet passed overhead, all Firebenders experienced a monumen- tal increase in their abilities. With this temporary amplification of power, the Fire Nation killed all of the Air Nomads and severely damaged their temples.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The speed and efficiency the Fire Nation used to exterminate the Air Nomads stunned the world. While the Air Nomads’ allies intended to come to their aid, they were busy contending with the Fire Nation on other fronts, creating the perfect envi- ronment for the Fire Lord’s nefarious plans. Fire Lord Sozin’s actions in the Roku Era built up the Fire Nation’s military to a force that the Air Nomads were unable to contend with. Though Avatar Aang was the prime target of the attack, he ended up being the only survivor of the Air Nomads—though that truth is unknown to the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads are now relegated to footnotes in history books for the new generation of this era. Even then, there is little history the Fire Nation hasn’t warped to fit its narrative and many records on Air Nomads are incomplete. A few people may visit their temples and wonder at the lost civilization but a scant few truly remember the Nomads.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• There are no Air Nomads.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark58" class="s46">• The Air Nomad temples are for the most part empty (see the Mechanist on page 63).</a>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• There is no one to tend to the spiritual sites the Air Nomads once cared for.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Southern Water Tribe Raids</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forty years into the war, Fire Lord Sozin’s successor, Azulon, targeted the Waterbenders of the Southern Water Tribe. His soldiers took many Waterbenders to high security prisons or murdered them, and the population of the Southern Water Tribe dropped drastically. Rather than helping their fellow tribespeo- ple, the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe further isolated themselves, shoring up their own defenses in case the ire of the Fire Nation turned on them next. This served to isolate the two tribes from one another, where they once presented a united front on many occasions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark63" class="s22">The Southern Water Tribe raids only ended when Azulon was satisfied that he rid the world of the last Southern Waterbender, a woman named Kya. In truth, she was not the bender they were seeking, but lied and said she was to protect her daughter Katara, the real Waterbender (page 72).</a>
</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Southern Water Tribe numbers are dwindling.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Most Southern Waterbenders are imprisoned.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The remaining Southern Water Tribe warriors have left their homes to launch guerilla attacks on the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Siege of Ba Sing Se</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The failed Siege of Ba Sing Se ended only a few years ago after lasting a grueling six hundred days. General Iroh, heir to the Fire Nation throne at the time, led the siege. The Fire Army got as far as breaching the Outer Wall and made their way through the Agrarian Zone. Around this time, Iroh’s son, Lu Ten, was badly injured in the assault and soon succumbed to his wounds. Suffering his son’s death made Iroh realize that the siege cost too many lives and destroyed the morale of the soldiers. Iroh ended the siege and eventually Ba Sing Se retook their lost ground and repaired the Outer Wall.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Ba Sing Se is one of the last strongholds of the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Ba Sing Se government grows increasingly xenophobic.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Fire Nation is working on new technologies to breach the Outer Wall.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Death of Fire Lord Azulon</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After Iroh withdrew from Ba Sing Se, his brother Ozai demand- ed that their father remove Iroh as heir to the Fire Nation throne. Fire Lord Azulon, infuriated by this demand, ordered Ozai to kill his firstborn, Zuko, so that he would understand the pain of losing a firstborn son as Iroh had. Ozai planned to follow these orders, but his wife Ursa made a deal with him instead. She cre- ated a poison Ozai could use on his father in exchange for him sparing Zuko’s life. Ozai banished Ursa and secretly assassinated Azulon so he could claim the throne.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Ozai, not Iroh, is the current Fire Lord.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Prince Zuko is exiled from the Fire Nation until he finds the Avatar.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Ursa is missing, presumed dead.</p>
