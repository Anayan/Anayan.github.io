<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Korra Era sees the rise of a new phenomenon—the corporation—giant international companies that pro- vide goods and services across the globe. This new age means people can get things faster than ever before and corporations use their resources to ensure they’re the</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">ones getting new products to consumers rather than their competitors. Some news sources even speculate that the rise of these large conglomerations could mean the death of local business, but the era is young and who knows where the future will lead? A few of the largest corpora- tions are Future Industries, Cabbage Corp, and of course Varrick Global Industries.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Headed by the infamous Southern Water Tribe busi- nessman Varrick, Varrick Global Industries is the premier corporation for technological development. It develops the best, most innovative inventions, devices that are both practical and delightful. One of the most famous inventions by Varrick and used by his company was mov- ers (movies), which began as propaganda, but are now embraced as an a popular form of entertainment.</p>

</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Korra Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom has experienced nonstop turmoil since the assassination of Queen Hou-Ting. King Wu currently governs the kingdom, though he intends to rule only for as long as necessary until the kingdom can successfully transition into a democratic nation. The monarchy is still important to many people within the Earth Kingdom, and if the recent events with the Earth Empire have taught the leaders of the Earth Kingdom anything, it’s that wide-scale change takes time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Since the kingdom is fresh off two dictatorships that exploit- ed the vulnerabilities of small villages contending with poverty and bandits, trust in authority figures is hard to come by. Life in its smaller villages has never been easy, and promises of safety usually come with ulterior motives. King Wu’s wish for democ- racy is a far cry from anything people in rural communities need at any given moment. Food and shelter are at the forefront of people’s minds; to that end, many people move from the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">countryside to the city in search of work. Unfortunately, many of these immigrants find larger city governments too overloaded to care for them and triads willing to take advantage of them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In Ba Sing Se, citizens must learn how to navigate life without the wall between the Lower and Middle Rings. While many who lived in the Lower Ring despised the wall, many in the Middle Ring enjoyed it, because they felt it improved their quality of life. Now the well-off are forced to mingle with the poor, and oppor- tunities to change one’s fortunes are there for anyone enterpris- ing enough to seize them. It’s an unprecedented time of integra- tion in Ba Sing Se, and it’s unlikely to be a smooth transition.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Wu</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A king ushering his kingdom into a new age of democracy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Wu is the 54<span class="s45">th </span>Earth Monarch. Young, privileged, and used to a life of comfort, Wu looked forward to taking the throne after his great aunt Hou-Ting’s assassination. Unfortunately, Kuvira spoke against his rise to power during his coronation and effectively usurped him. Since then, Wu has grown up a lot, though he still loves to break into song at inappropriate times. He is a gifted public speaker and knows how to both work up and calm a crowd. While he still has moments of shallow vanity, he is steadily learning more about what it means to govern. After trying to rush the process of turning the Earth Kingdom into a democracy, Wu understands that his people need time to adjust, and patience is a necessary part of leadership. Heroes who want to help Wu might volunteer to oversee elections in different re- gions of the Earth Kingdom and protect them from sabotage. As a public figure, Wu also needs constant protection from threats.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Suyin Beifong</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A metalbending pioneer and the leader of Zaofu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark70" class="s22">Suyin is the leader and founder of Zaofu, a city that’s home to many Earthbenders who can metalbend, collectively known as the Metal Clan. She is also the daughter of the famed Toph Beifong. Like her mother and sister, Lin (page 82),</a> Suyin is highly skilled in metalbending. She has five children, a passion for the arts, and takes a particular interest in dance. Unlike her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sister, Suyin is a cheerful free spirit and had an irresponsible and rebellious streak as a teenager. The two sisters did not get along when they were young because of this difference, but Suyin has matured since then.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Baatar Jr., Suyin’s son, was engaged to Kuvira until her defeat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Empire uprising and Gaoling Crisis both hit Suyin hard. She, along with the rest of the Metal Clan, have even less tolerance for aspiring military dictators now than ever before.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Toph Beifong</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An elderly metalbending master who keeps getting pulled back into the fray</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Toph Beifong continued to help out Avatar Aang throughout</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">her adult life just as she had in her youth. After teaching metal- bending for a time, she settled in Republic City and served as its chief of police. Many decades have passed since then, and Toph spends much of her time in Foggy Swamp where she’d be enjoying the peace and quiet, if not for the world continually bothering her!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When Avatar Korra suffered from the effects of mercury poisoning, Toph aided her. When Suyin and her family were captured by the Earth Empire, Toph came to the rescue. After that, Korra and King Wu asked Toph to run for office in Gaol- ing…and she very reluctantly agreed to do so. The election was called off, but Toph helped resolve the overall crisis and is back in the swamp trying to find some peace once again. Heroes who want this metalbending master’s help will have a very tricky time convincing her to yet again come out of retirement.</p>

<a name="bookmark73">Kuvira</a>
</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A former dictator of a failed regime looking for redemption</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kuvira did a lot of damage when she tried to form the Earth Empire and is now eager to fix her mistakes. Kuvira only recently owned up to the full extent of the wrongs she committed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark69" class="s22">Returning home to Zaofu was humbling for Kuvira and she was forced to face her ex-fiancée, Bataar Jr., whom she tried to kill with a spirit energy weapon. By acknowledging the people she hurt with her actions, Kuvira started down the road towards re- demption. Her genuine remorse and assistance ending the Earth Empire (page 81)</a> was enough that she is allowed to be under house arrest in Zaofu rather than prison.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kuvira is a skilled military leader and tactician. She’s smart, can think on her feet, and is willing to make tough calls for caus- es she believes in. While she may offer help in order to redeem herself further, trusting her is not a simple matter. Even if her intentions are honest, plenty of people don’t believe she has the right to redemption. If King Wu, Suyin Beifong, and the Avatar all agree to send her on a mission, they will likely assign people to watch her carefully. This job also necessarily includes prevent- ing angry civilians from trying to assassinate her if they see her out in the world.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark69" class="s22">A scientist named Dr. Sheng developed advanced brainwashing methods for Commander Guan’s (page 81)</a> use. While its ef- fects have been negated in Gaoling, it is still at risk of being used elsewhere by anyone who had a chance to investigate or steal the technology. Well-meaning, enterprising inventors may research the technology trying to see if it has practical uses in society, beyond mass population control. However, it is a slippery slope experimenting with such destructive technology and the effects could be disastrous.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those brainwashed during the Gaoling Crisis may experience possible unpredictable side effects in the future. Should rumors spread of odd behavior somewhere in the Earth Kingdom, King Wu or Suyin might send heroes to the source to determine whether brainwashing plays a role. Otherwise, heroes might find that an enemy is truly being controlled by someone else through brainwashing.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Wu intends to abolish the Earth Kingdom monarchy, but it’s a slow process since not everyone in the kingdom is ready for it. No two states in the Earth Kingdom are identical, so it is hard to say how any one of them will react to the news of a potential election. Each state has been tasked by Wu with holding their own elections, but may do so on their own time table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many rural inhabitants are so busy focused on trying to find their next meal that democracy seems like a distant concept.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corrupt local politicians who are currently in power capitalize on the rampant poverty by feeding their citizens lies about hold- ing elections, placing the blame on the Earth King. It may seem like King Wu is shifting his responsibilities to care for his people onto someone else. Heroes may need to protect people running for office, and in especially tough situations, they may need to convince potential candidates to run at all.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earth Empire Loyalists</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some still believe the United Republic of Nations should belong to the Earth Kingdom, and that the kingdom is no place for people from other nations. It is a strange time to be living in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Earth Kingdom if you or your family are multicultural or originally from one of the other nations. The nation is the most blended it has ever been, but Earth Kingdom fundamentalists threaten the established diversity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since there were two attempted uprisings back-to-back, it isn’t hard to imagine more taking place in the future. The Gaoling Cri- sis is not the last time nationalism inspires a harmful movement in the Earth Kingdom, and some regions might inch closer to a civil war. If the heroes are lucky and clever, they might stop a disaster from blowing up in the first place. Otherwise, they may have to navigate another uprising as they pursue their goals.</p>

<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Korra Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi skillfully leads the Fire Nation into a brighter future, holding fast to the ideals of her father Zuko. The Fire Lord’s government uses an abundance of caution when it comes to military engagements or anything that has the potential to lead them closer to the nation’s old ways. As far as they are con- cerned, war is only an option when there are absolutely no other options left. Fire Lord Izumi only offered military help to the United Republic of Nations when Raiko, the former president, agreed to focus on defensive measures instead of aggressive ones in the fight against the Earth Empire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation government now looks inward to determine how they should be structured. Fire Lord Izumi is concerned not only about what best serves them now, but also what supports and serves them in the eras to come. She and many of her officials hope to soon invite the other nations to establish embassies within the capital of Hari Bulkan to continue foster- ing peaceful and cooperative relations. Before moving forward on that front, the government is removing the last of the Fire Nation monuments erected to honor those who perpetuated war crimes during the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Zuko is still alive and invested in the well-being of the Avatar and the world at large. Since stepping down as Fire Lord, he has made being an ambassador for the Fire Nation his first priority. Izumi’s son, Iroh, a general in the United Forces, helps to solidify the Fire Nation’s relationship with the United Republic of Nations. He and Izumi both see to it that the Fire Nation continues to make reparations for the damage done during the Hundred Year War.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cautious Fire Lord who is mindful of her nation’s history</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi is famous for her efforts to reform the Fire Nation’s government and cultivate peaceful relations with the other nations, including the United Republic of Nations. Her father Zuko shares her eagerness to continue moving away from the Fire Nation’s brutal past. Izumi is calm, rational, and steadfast, making decisions on behalf of the Fire Nation that not only take its well-being in mind, but the well-being of the rest of the world as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">She has little tolerance for jokes or levity in serious discus- sions, as she is determined to treat important decisions with the respect they deserve. Heroes who hail from the Fire Nation and serve the Fire Lord must conduct themselves with the utmost integrity, because their behavior reflects the nation as a whole. Izumi’s standards are high, and she is very particular about who she sends out into the world on the Fire Nation’s behalf.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dalja Ro</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The head of a special force dedicated to helping when disaster strikes <span class="p">Dalja Ro is the driven and tireless leader of the Fire Nation’s Relief Fleet. Dalja first inspired the fleet over a decade ago when they still served as an admiral in the Fire Navy. When a volcano erupted and devastated the village at its base, Dalja rerouted ships to rescue civilians and provide medical aid. The govern- ment was so impressed that they tasked Dalja with organizing</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a fleet dedicated to aiding civilians during disasters. Soon, the fleet was being dispatched to lend help after earthquakes, mine collapses, and tsunamis.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Dalja never turns down anyone who wants to help and is especially grateful when benders from other nations offer up their services. They often recruit graduates from the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, where they went to school. During their time at the Academy, Dalja realized they didn’t truly feel like a girl, and the support of their classmates helped shape Dalja into the person they are today. They remain an admiral in the Fire Navy, but the Fire Nation has committed to funding the Relief Fleet for actions throughout the world, anywhere that needs its help.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zuko</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The former Fire Lord who still seeks to help bring peace to the world <span class="p">Since he stepped down from the throne, Zuko lives on Ember Island, a famed vacation spot. He has hardly been living a life of pure serenity, however, as he’s kept himself busy supporting the policies of his daughter, Fire Lord Izumi, and promoting peace in the world. Outside of the Fire Nation, he is also heavily invested in the well-being of Republic City and the Southern Water Tribe.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Zuko is quick to act when he can be of service, often traveling long distances on his dragon, Druk, to lend aid. He was intense and impulsive in his youth, but now the former Fire Lord’s pas- sions are tempered by the years of wisdom under his belt, and he uses his experience to help wherever he can. Zuko’s priority is his family and if danger strikes, he’s there. Since Zuko carries</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a lot of clout, he can also pull some strings on a hero’s behalf, especially in the Fire Nation, Republic City, or the Southern Water Tribe.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A general in the United Forces with a strong moral compass</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Iroh, named after his great-granduncle, is a leader in the United Republic of Nations’ military and Fire Lord Izumi’s son. Iroh is charismatic and thoughtful with a kind heart and military mind like his late great uncle. Though part of the Fire Nation Royal Family, he serves in the United Forces and strictly follows his orders, even on the rare occasion when they go against the Avatar’s wishes. Despite that fact, Iroh and Korra have worked together more often than they’ve worked against each other.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Technically, Iroh is in line for the Fire Nation throne, but his status as a general in the United Forces makes that uncertain. Fire Lord Izumi’s goal to stay outside of military conflicts doesn’t always mesh with Iroh’s duties and the two sometimes disagree when it comes to the best course of action when the United Re- public calls on Fire Nation aid. Politicians and military advisors alike are curious to see what direction Iroh takes in the future; they wonder if he will continue his loyalty to the United Repub- lic, or if he will embrace his role as Fire Nation prince. If heroes need military backup or if they suspect a large-scale attack will be launched against the United Republic of Nations, they may want to turn to Iroh for help.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are difficult decisions to be made whenever other nations ask the Fire Nation to lend military assistance. Since the end of the Hundred Year War, the Fire Nation has tried to steer away from its heavily militarized history. Maintaining distance from the Fire Nation’s imperialist past means fighting against genera- tions-worth of history that has shaped the nation, and Fire Lord Izumi isn’t about to make any decisions about military matters lightly. Likewise, Izumi learned lessons from her father in caring for her people and knows the careful balancing act needed be- tween putting your people first and caring for the international community. Many officials and citizens in the Fire Nation feel similarly and support the Fire Lord’s decisions. Should anyone come to the Fire Nation for assistance from their armed forces, it had better be because they are the last possible resort.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation is dedicated to repairing as much harm from the Hundred Year War as possible, and they continue to take measures to do so to this day. For instance, the Fire Nation and Southern Water Tribe scholars work on a traveling showcase of tribal history to celebrate it throughout the world. Fire Nation officials have also done their best to return Air Nomad relics to the Air Acolytes and the burgeoning Air Nation, though some were destroyed or lost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi continues her father’s practice of sending workers to assist in overseas construction projects and relief efforts as a natural outgrowth from their reparations work. Sometimes the other nations need a very specialized kind of help, like when dark spirits or extremist groups attack, or something im- portant is stolen. In these cases, Izumi may send heroes with spe- cialized experience and knowledge on behalf of the Fire Nation.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legend has it that dragons were the first Firebenders. Now, there are only three known dragons left in the world, and Zuko has met them all. When he was a teenager, he befriended Ran and Shaw on the Sun Warrior’s Island. In his 20s, he found a juvenile dragon he named Druk, who shared an ancestry with Ran and Shaw. Over the years, Druk grew up and became Zuko’s loyal companion, and the two of them flew around the world together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are people out there who specifically like to hunt rare, majestic animals, however, and if they take risks to capture sky bison, they are almost certainly willing to take big risks to cap- ture a creature as rare as a dragon. Additionally, conservationists may want to search the wilderness for possible undocumented dragons in order to establish a sanctuary for them. If any other dragons exist it could mean a new renaissance for the species.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part18.htm#bookmark31" class="s22">The Air Nation is revitalized now that there are more Airbend- ers in the world again. Thanks to the work of Avatar Aang and his allies, the Nomad temples are now fully restored (save the Northern Air Temple; see page 26)</a> and Acolytes preserve the ways of the Nomads for generations to come. The Air Nation now strives to help bring balance to the world as their predeces- sors did before the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The culture might not be the same as it once was, but this group of Airbenders and Air Acolytes work together to form a new cultural identity informed by, but not the same as, its past. For quite some time, Avatar Aang’s son, Tenzin, and his three eldest children were the only Airbenders in the world with the excep- tion of Korra. After Harmonic Convergence, many non-benders suddenly gained airbending abilities. Now, the Air Nation is made up of Acolytes and Airbenders from each of the other nations. The sky bison population even bounced back.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark54" class="s22">The Nomads recently took on the responsibility of caring for the Republic City spirit portal. Relations between spirits and humans have been rough since the spirit portals re-opened, but the Airbenders and Acolytes work hard to help keep balance between the physical world and the Spirit World. It’s a natural role for them to take, as the Air Nomads communed with spirits for thousands of years before the genocide (page 58).</a>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tenzin</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An airbending master raising a family of Airbenders in a dangerous world</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Tenzin is Avatar Aang and Katara’s son. He has spent his life</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">keeping the practice of airbending and Air Nomad culture alive. His wife, Pema, is an Air Acolyte, and three of his children— Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo—are Airbenders while the fourth, Ro- han, is still a toddler whose bending abilities may not have mani- fested yet. Some consider Tenzin to be uptight and strict, but his behavior is born out of a deep desire to uphold his father’s legacy and ensure a decent future for his family and the Air Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Tenzin was also Avatar Korra’s airbending teacher. The two have not always seen eye to eye and both Tenzin and Korra can be stubborn, which causes friction between the two. However, Tenzin’s years and experience have taught him patience—a trait that often mends any disagreements the two may have. The rela- tionship Tenzin and Korra share is special, a friendship forged in forgiveness and acceptance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">He has tried to pass on his spirituality to his children, and Jinora has taken a special interest in the spiritual matters of Air Nomad culture. Heroes who want to pursue a spiritual quest might come to Tenzin for advice. Likewise, anyone fighting to protect the Air Nation and its history has an ally in Tenzin.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jinora</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An airbending master with a knack for understanding spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jinora is an extremely skilled Airbender and a master at navigat- ing the Spirit World, communicating with spirits and befriend- ing them. She is particularly adept at spirit projection and locat- ing people and things while her consciousness is outside of her body. When her father couldn’t help the Avatar enter the Spirit World, it was Jinora who proved capable and did so instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Soon after, Jinora was anointed an airbending master and given her arrow tattoos, the mark of a master Airbender. It’s a distinc- tion she shares only with her father and Korra.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the oldest of her siblings, Jinora can occasionally get frustrated when the others distract her, complain, or question her decisions. She is greatly respected by the other members of the Air Nation and has taught airbending since she was very young. Any- one having difficulty with spirits or wanting to develop their spiri- tual abilities could find no one better to help them than Jinora.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bumi</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A clever military commander who recently developed airbending abilities</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Bumi is the eldest of Avatar Aang and Katara’s three children,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and up until a few years ago, he was a non-bender. As the Com- mander of the Second Division of the United Forces, Bumi was a skilled leader, daring almost to the point of recklessness. He has a knack for spotting advantageous tactical opportunities even in the most dire of circumstances. The recent Harmonic Conver- gence threw a new challenge Bumi’s way when he developed airbending skills. He had to learn how to use these abilities from scratch and is still working on mastering them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Bumi tends to tell elaborate and dramatic stories that most people believe are greatly embellished. Though he occasionally acts out in immature ways, Bumi would do anything for his family and doesn’t run away from difficult situations. Those who aspire to become world-class military strategists could learn a lot from him, as he is well-respected by his peers and superiors alike in the United Forces. Just don’t expect a conventional education.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New Airbenders</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Individuals who developed airbending after Harmonic Convergence <a href="part37.htm#bookmark72" class="s22">The Air Nation now includes a growing number of Airbenders who come from all over the world, such as Suyin Beifong’s (page </a>
<span class="p">86) daughter Opal and a former thief named Kai who were</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">both born in the Earth Kingdom. These new Airbenders were so valuable that Earth Queen Hou-Ting had many abducted and forced them to join her army. Avatar Korra, Tenzin, and Bumi rescued the Airbenders from the queen and gave them the op- tion to either go their own ways or train under Tenzin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most Airbenders have a few years of training under their belt, but not all people with airbending talents joined the Air Na- tion—some are still out there, reluctant to leave their loved ones behind. Airbenders who choose to train with Tenzin continue the tradition of travelling and aiding the Avatar. Now the new Airbenders can be found all over the globe. Some live a nomadic lifestyle and travel from place to place looking to be of service, while others care for the Air Temples, and still others haven’t yet joined the Air Nation as a whole.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">down, leaving only ruins. Any history it held is lost, save for what lives on in the surviving Air Nomads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Some of the Air Nation may wish to find a place to fill the gap that this temple has left, and there may even be those who hold out hope of somehow rebuilding the temple. However, if the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Air Nation were to rebuild the temple, they’d need substantial assistance and resources to do so. Then, there is the question as to what form will the temple take? And will it be a bastion of Nomad history or a modernized temple of a new era? Without</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">someone willing to take on this monumental task, the Northern Air Temple remains lost for now.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plenty of people developed airbending abilities after Harmon- ic Convergence but decided not to train at the Northern Air Temple with the others. Some of them may still struggle with these new abilities, and some may have decided to put them to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nefarious uses. Airbending is a difficult art to master, and a bend- er may never reach their full potential without guidance.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those who come to the Air Nomads now might have spent time using incorrect techniques that are hard to correct now that they’ve become habits. Retraining them will be difficult both</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for the students and for their teachers. The effort is worth it, though—Air Nomads are needed now more than ever. Not only to work with the growing number of spirits, but to be a force of balance in the world.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Portal Caretakers</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked themes: Setting Boundaries</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads are now caretakers of the spirit portal in Re- public City, along with the lands that surround them. Not only must the Nomads contend with people looking to exploit the portal for personal gain, but they must work with the spirits who wish to live in the mortal world. This is no easy task, especially for a nation as small as the Air Nomads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The push and pull between spirits and humans can be hard to navigate. This is exemplified in Republic City, where the spirits have taken over large portions of the city and the human inhabitants struggle with their new neighbors. Many spirits feel humans must simply accept their presence, but it’s a hard matter to contend with as humans often see themselves as the center of the world. Unresolved issues with living alongside one another mean humans and spirits could fight, an event the Air Nomads work tirelessly to prevent.</p>
