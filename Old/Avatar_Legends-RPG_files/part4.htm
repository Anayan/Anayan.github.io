<p class="s12" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Originally, this setting was only a single show—<i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>—that told the story of Avatar Aang’s journey to mas- ter the four elements and save the world. But this world’s history spans thousands of years, and over time, many more of its stories across multiple eras of Avatars have been told—including com- ics, novels, and of course, the epic series featuring Aang’s succes- sor, <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. Together, these works make up <i>Avatar Legends</i>, a broad term for all of the different stories that detail the adventures of heroes of the Four Nations (and Republic City). This vast universe of <i>Avatar Legends </i>is often referred to as <span class="s20">the Avatarverse</span>—a universe that encompasses the entire human and natural history of this unique world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>gives you and your friends a chance to create your own <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories within five distinct eras, including tools for creating your own heroes and your own adventures in the Avatarverse. You and your friends get to be the team of heroes at the center of your own show, exploring the Four Nations, confronting threats, and saving the day just like Team Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’ve never played a tabletop roleplaying game before, welcome! Starting a new hobby can feel daunting, but everything you need to learn how to play is included right here in this book, including how to make your heroes and tell amazing stories in the Avatarverse. Don’t be afraid to jump in and get started; the best way to learn how to roleplay is to try it out for yourself!</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">A World of Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many people in the Avatarverse are <span class="s20">benders, </span>possessing the ability to manipulate one of the four elements—earth, fire, air, or water. But whether they’re benders or non-benders, the peo- ple of this world have faced centuries of trials and tribulations, conflicts within and between nations, peoples, and even spirits!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For most of the world’s history, <span class="s20">the Avatar</span>—a human capable of bending all four elements—has been responsible for maintaining <span class="s20">balance </span>in the world and serving as a bridge between the spiritual and physical planes of existence. Following a cycle through the elements from earth to fire, fire to air, air to water, and water back</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to earth, the Avatar reincarnates after each lifetime into a different nation, carrying forward the Avatar Spirit and its great responsibility. Many people look to the Avatar for guidance and justice, hoping to see the most capable bender in the world solve their problems and placing an enormous burden on this lone person to be a savior.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But the Avatar is not the only hero in this world. Many are called to bring balance where there is disorder and seek jus- tice where there is suffering. Some of these heroes are benders themselves, but others use martial arts, weapon training, or technology to triumph in their amazing adventures and build a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">better world. These heroes might sometimes stand with the Ava- tar in times of great trouble, but often they must join with other heroes—without the Avatar’s guidance—to bring balance.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s21">What is Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game? </span>In <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, you and your friends tell a story about a group of young heroes who join together to fight for what’s right in a complicated and nuanced world. One of your friends acts as the gamemaster (GM), describing the prob- lems the heroes face and the people they meet along the way; the rest of you take on the roles of individual heroes, seeking to make the Avatarverse a better place.</p>
