<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changing History</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Depending on which era you chose for your game, it’s possible that the PCs’ actions might alter the history of the setting. For example, a group of he- roes in Roku’s Era might stop Fire Lord Sozin from building up his military to attack the Air Nomads by alerting Avatar Roku to Sozin’s true motives. How could he wipe out the Air Nomads without suffi- cient forces?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">It’s best to decide before you start playing how your group wants to handle events that disrupt the ca- nonical history of the Avatarverse. For some, the of- ficial history might be a mere guide, an idea of what might happen, easily disrupted by brave adventurers. Others might view the events featured in <b>Chapter 2: The World of Avatar </b>as unalterable; either changes <i>cannot </i>happen if they alter history or some other event must change the setting back off-screen.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There’s no right answer to how to play the game! Just make sure that everyone at your table knows how your group is dealing with the established history before you start play!</p>

<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">those out when applicable—“The Successor is a high <span class="s49">Creativity </span>and <span class="s49">Focus </span>playbook, so they spend a lot of time looking for advantages (or even <span class="s8">tricking </span>people) and are pretty competent when they <span class="s8">rely on their skills and training</span>. Does that sound fun?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone has had time to make their characters, go ahead and have each player introduce their PC. Some folks might need a bit more time, but they can catch up as everyone else introduces their characters!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Asking Probing Questions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the players are introducing their characters, ask them probing questions to expand on what they say. Try to alternate between asking questions about the information they’ve already given you—“Why did your mother give you her most cher- ished sword?”—and asking new questions that ties them to the scope and focus of the story. Everyone should already have an answer to “Why do you care about this group or purpose?” but dig deeper, asking questions like “How did you meet the other PCs?” or “When did you first learn that [foe] was a threat?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The goal of these questions is to both help players think about their characters and to give you lots of material to use in future conflicts. If the Prodigy’s mother gave him a cherished sword because she was so proud of her son’s skills, you can bring that character into play—either directly when she appears in the story or through NPCs who reflect her view of the Prodigy. Probing questions give you tools for invoking the emotions and conflicts the players want to see their characters engage, and all you have to do to figure out what they want to see in the story is ask them!</p>
