<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When you’re not sure which agenda you’re aiming for, when the other players ask you a question and you’re left a little blank, rely on your baselines. In general, always say:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• What the guidelines demand</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• What the rules demand</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• What honesty demands</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What the guidelines demand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rely on the guidelines to steer your story and maintain a tone and theme consistent with that of the Avatarverse. Keep them in mind always; they are useful when it comes to building the world, in coming up with story ideas, and in imagining how NPCs react. They will help you reach the agendas and are flexible enough to cover a lot of different situations. For example, <i>be the companions’ biggest fan </i>means you should both provide them with opportu- nities to show off their powers and triumph over adversity and challenge them by showcasing the way their actions lead to mean- ingful (if unexpected) changes to the larger world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If more than one guideline applies in a given situation, that’s okay! As long as you follow a guideline that supports your agen- das, there won’t be a wrong choice between the different guide- lines. In the end, there’s no difference between focusing on <i>seeking consequences beyond death </i>and <i>using imbalance instead of evil</i>, if both guidelines lead you toward conflicts that fit the Avatarverse!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, you don’t need to remember every single guide- line all the time—if you ever need to remind yourself in the moment or if you aren’t sure which to follow, check out your GM reference sheets!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What the rules demand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Stick to the rules and be consistent. If a PC is about to be knocked out by taking another condition, don’t backtrack or fudge that fact when they tell you they don’t have any conditions left to mark.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since player characters can’t be permanently killed (except for rare circumstances, when there’s agreement between the player and the GM), keeping to the rules only enhances your story. After all, not even the Avatar wins every single fight!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Keeping to the rules helps to create a consistent space for your players to engage the fiction; if they know they can never lose— or never win!—because you have your thumb on the scale, their choices won’t be real or meaningful. Letting the dice fall where they may means that both you and they know the decisions they make matter to the fiction you all build together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that “always say what the rules demand” does not mean that you must always call for rolls for every tiny action. You as GM adjudicate when the situation is uncertain, and when a move is called for. The rules are a tool for telling great stories together; you shouldn’t ever ignore them, but focus on invoking them when it’s productive for the story!</p>
