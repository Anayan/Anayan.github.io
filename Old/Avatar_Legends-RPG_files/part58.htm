<p style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the basic moves, every character can make any of the <span class="s20">balance moves </span>too. These moves affect your character’s balance track, their principles, and the balance of others. The five balance moves are <span class="s8">live up to your principle</span>, <span class="s8">call someone out</span>, <span class="s8">deny a callout</span>, <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance</span>, and <span class="s8">lose your</span>
</p>
<p class="s8" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">balance<a href="part42.htm#bookmark84" class="s22">. Your character’s balance is their heart, what guides their story, and their long-term development all in one. This section explains how each of these crucial systems and moves work in detail. For more on the general systems of your principles and balance, see page 102.</a>

</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you <b>take action in accordance with the values of a principle</b>, mark 1-fatigue to roll with that principle instead of whatever stat you would normally roll.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Hammer wants to punch an antagonistic NPC that they blame for a bad situation, but realizes their target isn’t some evil mastermind…they’re scared and being manipulated by others. Rather than give in to their instincts, the Hammer offers a hand to the other person and declares that they understand what they’re going through and want to help, not hurt them—the Hammer is <span class="s8">guiding and comforting </span>that NPC, but also <span class="s8">living up to their principle </span>of Care!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Any time you take action that aligns with one of your play- book’s two principles on your balance track, you can <span class="s8">live up to your principle </span>before you make your move. Rather than roll with the stat that move normally tells you to, you roll with the prin- ciple’s value on your balance track. This means as your balance track shifts hard to one side, you roll with an increasingly high bonus when <span class="s8">living up to your principle </span>in that direction. In this way, you can offset a low or negative stat by <span class="s8">living up to your principle </span>if that principle matches your action. However, this isn’t something you can do all the time—pushing yourself to embody a principle in this way always costs 1-fatigue!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To trigger this move, your action needs to meet two condi- tions. First, it has to be an action that triggers a move with a stat roll (basic, playbook, even the <span class="s8">stance move</span>)—if a move tells you to roll without any modifiers, you can’t <span class="s8">live up to your prin- ciple</span>, just like how you can’t if a move’s outcome doesn’t require you to roll dice. Second, it has to fit the values of one of your principles. When the Icon <span class="s8">intimidates </span>someone into backing down, it’s not enough for them to say they’re <span class="s8">living up to their principle </span>of Role—they need to describe and show how they’re using their belief in their position and their status as the Icon in this moment, in order to use their Role instead of their <span class="s49">Passion</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you want to <span class="s8">live up to your principle </span>but you’re not sure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">how, talk to the GM or the group about how you can make your actions align with the principle you’re trying to live up to. The GM might tell you that you need to do a little more to truly live up to that principle, or that you might need to pursue another course of action to live up to the principle.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Teru Jinno the Hammer, played by Tyrelle, is trying to keep a squad of metalbending police away from local street rat Ping, who&#39;s been framed for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. The police are ready to knock Teru Jinno out, but he doesn&#39;t exactly want to harm them—he</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">just wants to hold them off long enough for Ping to escape. The exchange begins, and Tyrelle chooses that Teru Jinno defends and maneuvers—he thinks that&#39;s the best way to try to divert the police without really harming them that much.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Great! Roll with <span class="s49">Focus</span>, then, for the stance move!&quot; says the GM. &quot;I have <span class="s49">Focus </span>-1, but I want to live up to my principle instead—</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">this is Care, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Is it? Still seems like you&#39;re forcefully trying to keep the police at bay,&quot; says the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Sure, but I&#39;m not just thrashing them, and I&#39;m not relying on intimidating them with my sheer strength or anything,&quot; says Tyrelle. &quot;I&#39;m keeping them busy, and I&#39;m taking care not to actually hurt them too much. In addition to the fact that I&#39;m doing all of this because I care about Ping.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;The second thing seems a little iffy to me,&quot; says the GM. &quot;You get into fights all the time because you care about people, so that&#39;s not really how I understood Care to work for you. But the fact that you&#39;re being cautious and careful in the fight, not just slamming them, makes sense. It kind of suggests to me that you&#39;re not about to pick techniques that wildly rip up the area or anything, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yeah, for sure,&quot; says Tyrelle. &quot;I&#39;ll see what I roll before I pick, but I&#39;m aiming toward stuff like Seize a Position to move my humming- bird mecha into the way, or Ready to try to fire one of my foam canisters and make it hard for them to keep coming at us.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">&quot;Randomly throwing sticky, hardening foam into an alley is about as careful as it gets for the Hammer,&quot; says the GM, smiling. &quot;Sounds good! Mark 1-fatigue and roll with Care!&quot;</p>

<a name="bookmark116">Call Someone Out</a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you <b>openly call on someone to live up to their princi- ple</b>, shift your balance away from center, then name and roll with their principle. On a hit, they are called to act as you say; they must either do it or mark a condition. On a 7–9, they challenge your view of the world in turn; mark 1-fatigue or they shift your balance as they choose. On a miss, they can demand you act in accordance with one of your principles instead; mark a condition or act as they request.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you make this move, you remind someone (a PC or NPC) of one of their principles and call on them to take immediate action related to that ideal. You might be reminding them of their respon- sibilities, begging them to live up to their ideals, or calling them on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">how their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs. You can’t trigger this move by being subtle—you must openly call on them to do</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so. When characters in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra </i>tell people to their face or in front of others that they need to step up or act a certain way by appealing to their beliefs or using their own words against them, they’re <span class="s8">calling someone out</span>!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you make this move, you need to shift your own balance away from center first—this represents your character taking a strong position and standing up for what they believe in. You then name the principle you’re calling on your target to live up to, and roll with the value of that principle—meaning you roll with <i>their </i>balance, not your own. Someone with a strong belief in their prin- ciple is easier to push in this way, while someone whose worldview has shifted away from a belief is much harder to reach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember, you need to name your target’s principle to make this move—you need to know exactly how to appeal to their beliefs. If you already know someone’s principle (like another PC or an NPC whose principle you’ve learned through another move), you’re good to go. If you <i>think </i>you know an NPC’s principle and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">call them out, you can still try to name their principle. If you’re close enough that you essentially name the same idea, you can still make this move even if you’re not exactly correct about the phrasing. The GM is the final arbiter of whether or not you are close enough. For example, if an NPC’s principle is Justice and you call on them to live up to their principle of Law, the GM may decide it’s close enough.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a hit, your words land and your target is called to act as you say—but they still don’t <i>have </i>to do it, and you have <i>not </i>mind-con- trolled them somehow! Your target still has the agency to choose to do or not do what you called on them to do, even as they feel the pull of their principles. If they don’t choose to do what you call them to do, they must mark a condition as they feel internal conflict between what they want and their obligation. On a roll</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of 10+, that’s where things end, but on a 7–9, your target gets a dig at you as well that forces you to let them shift <i>your </i>balance in turn however they want (unless you mark a fatigue). If you mark a fatigue, you’re exerting yourself to rebut or ignore their push.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a miss, you still call your target out—but they not only deflect your words, they turn the moment to focus on <i>you </i>instead, pressuring you to act in accordance with one of <i>your </i>principles! Your words either don’t connect with them or they redirect your attempt to pressure them. This doesn’t have to be hostile or aggressive but just like when you <span class="s8">call someone out</span>, their response has weight to it. When the Hammer misses <span class="s8">calling out </span>a community leader to stand up to some local gangs, the community leader responds that attacking the gang will only make them angrier; she’ll take help resolving the situation but they demand the Hammer live up to their principle of Care, making them promise to negotiate with the gang instead of escalating to violence. The Hammer needs to either accept the NPC’s terms or mark a condition and keep their own counsel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that on a miss, you’re pushed to act in accordance with one of your principles but you aren’t being <span class="s8">called out</span>. The decision to either do as you’re requested or mark a condition is built into this move’s outcome. This means if you roll a miss to <span class="s8">call someone out</span>, you can’t <span class="s8">deny a callout </span>to refuse the demand they make as a result.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Beryl the Icon, played by Bei, wants to attack the group of Fire Na- tion mercenaries who have just abducted the glowing snakesquid spirit of the nearby swamp. &quot;We can free her!&quot; says Bei, speaking directly as Beryl. &quot;I have to free her! It&#39;s one of my duties!&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;We can&#39;t,&quot; says Quinn, speaking directly as Quartz the Guardian. &quot;You saw those mercenaries in action! They have a guy who shoots lightning from his mouth! And there&#39;s that lady whose hands just melted a sword as she blocked it! They&#39;re too dangerous. We need to be careful, take our time, not charge in.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;If we wait, they might get away! They might find refuge at a fortress or something!&quot; says Bei. &quot;We have to act now!&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s way too dangerous, and I won&#39;t let you do it,&quot; says Quinn &quot;Ugh! I wish I could <b>plead </b>with you!&quot; says Bei.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;You can&#39;t <b>plead </b>with Quartz because he&#39;s a PC,&quot; says the GM. &quot;But you can <b>call on him to live up to his principle</b>.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, great idea! Yeah! Your principles are Self-Reliance and Trust, right?&quot; asks Bei. Quinn nods. &quot;So…I think I&#39;m asking you to trust me. I want to call on you to live up to Trust!&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;What exactly do you say that really cinches you calling out Quartz?&quot; asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I say, &#39;Look. I&#39;m the Chitin Warrior. I&#39;m not just your little sister anymore. I was chosen by our elders, by the forest, and by Ochin&#39;—I give my stag-beetle a little pat when I say her name—&#39;and I need you to trust in me the way they did. I know we have to do this. Can you trust me that I know what I&#39;m doing?&#39;&quot; says Bei.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Excellent!&quot; says the GM as Quinn groans and nods—he agrees that what Beryl is saying would call on his Trust principle! &quot;Okay then, Beryl, go ahead and shift your balance away from center—sounds clearly like you&#39;re shifting toward Role—and then roll with Quartz&#39;s Trust.&quot; Bei rolls and gets an 8!</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Grr. I don&#39;t want to mark a condition, so I guess I will go along with this,&quot; says Quinn. &quot;But I&#39;m shifting your balance to- ward Role—&#39;Alright, Chitin Warrior,&#39; I say to Beryl. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever called you that before, out loud.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;d love to shift my balance toward Role, but that&#39;s getting a little high then…I mark 1-fatigue instead!&quot; says Bei.</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you <b>deny an NPC calling on you to live up to your principle</b>, roll with that principle. On a hit, act as they say or mark 1-fatigue. On a 10+, their words hit hard; you must also shift your balance towards the called-on principle. On a miss, you stand strong; clear a condition, clear 1-fatigue, or shift your balance, your choice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NPCs can, and will, call on you to live up to one of your principles just as you can call them out. When they do, you <i>must </i>choose: accept their words and do what they demand (whether you like it or not), or reject them and make this move. The NPC doesn’t have to know your principle; it’s up to the GM to tell you when their demand for action lines up with your internal struggles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When an NPC calls on you to live up to one of your principles and you <span class="s8">deny </span>them, you must roll with the called-on principle. If you’re the Idealist and have +2 Forgiveness and -2 Action, you roll with +2 if you reject a call to Forgiveness or -2 to reject a call to Action. But this move is reversed from most—if you <span class="s8">deny a callout</span>, then you want to roll <i>low</i>, not high. This means that it’s easier to reject NPCs calling on you to live up to the principle you’re neglect- ing…and much harder to resist living up to what you believe in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Unlike almost every other move, you have the most control when you roll a miss to <span class="s8">deny a callout</span>—a miss means that you hold your ground in the face of the NPC’s influence. In fact, your resilience allows you to either clear a condition, clear 1-fatigue, or shift your balance however you choose.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to shift your balance, you might shift away from the called-on principle to show them what you truly believe in or to outright reject their demands. You might shift towards the called-on principle instead, showing that while you chose not</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to follow their demands or their interpretation of the principle, your commitment to that core idea remains strong.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you roll a hit when <span class="s8">denying a callout</span>, they make you stop in your tracks; maybe you know deep down that they’re right, or maybe they hit a sore spot. You have a choice: either act as they say or mark 1-fatigue. On a 10+, you need to choose <i>and </i>you also shift your balance towards the called-on principle.</p>

Come back to the Yuyan Archers with me.&#39; He&#39;s definitely calling out your Excellence principle, Ren,&quot; says the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I want to <b>deny him calling me out</b>! &#39;I have friends here, people who care about me, and who&#39;ve already helped me become better.

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;On this move, rolling high means his words really got to you,&quot; the GM says. &quot;You&#39;ve got to agree to go with him right now—and you&#39;ve got to mean it, even if things change down the line—or you&#39;ve got to mark 1-fatigue.

<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Shift your balance towards the opposite principle</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Learn what their principle is (if they have one); if you already know, take +1 forward against them</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a miss, they know just what to say to throw you off bal- ance. Mark a condition, and the GM shifts your balance twice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most NPCs are complex characters with their own beliefs, goals, and feelings—just like your characters! As you interact with them, they may try to get you to see the world the way they do, shift-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing your balance as they provide mentorship, stand up for their beliefs, try to manipulate you, or tell you how things really are. In these moments they want to change your mind or challenge your beliefs, rather than call on you to act immediately a certain way (as with <span class="s8">calling someone out</span>). It’s more than just offering a different opinion—shifting your balance represents actively changing what you think (well-intentioned or not). You can either let them shape you and move your balance track in the direction of their choice… or push back against them and <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">When you <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance</span>, you’re not just choos- ing to ignore an NPC’s words—you’re rejecting any shift to your balance, the current state of your principles and beliefs. If you accept their words, you’re open to changing your perspective at this moment; if you resist them, you’re sticking to your guns.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To <span class="s8">resist</span>, you roll without a modifier—no stat applies. On a hit, you hold strong despite their actions and words, which means that your balance stays where it is, and you choose one response from the list of options (or two if you rolled a 10+).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to <i>&quot;clear a condition or mark growth,&quot; </i>you must immediately act to prove the NPC wrong. For example, if they try to shift your Guardian towards Self-Reliance by asserting that your friends will always let you down, and you successfully resist them, you need to show that NPC they’re wrong—per- haps by demonstrating your Trust in your companions. Doing so either reinvigorates you (by clearing a condition) or represents a moment of introspection that helps you learn about yourself or change (by marking growth).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to <i>&quot;shift your balance towards the opposite princi- ple,&quot; </i>you’re not just denying the NPC’s attempt to change your beliefs; you’re actively asserting beliefs opposed to what they have said. You don’t have to do anything special in the fiction, but it’s usually good to tell your group how they can tell you’ve steeled yourself in the face of the NPC’s influence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to <i>&quot;learn what their principle is,&quot; </i>you gain insight into the NPC as they try to push you towards (or away from) one of your principles. Their attempt to shift your balance reveals their own underlying philosophy, or (if you already know it) deepens your understanding of it. Once you know an NPC’s principle, you can start to make moves that require knowing it, like <span class="s8">calling out the NPC </span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark116" class="s22">(page 138).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you try to <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance </span>and roll a miss, however, the NPC’s words hit you extra hard. Maybe they know how to push your buttons, use your fears or insecurities against you, or just say the right thing at the right time. To reflect being struck in an emotional pressure point, you must mark a condi- tion and shift your balance <i>twice </i>in the direction of the GM’s choice. Almost always, that lines up with the NPC’s chosen di- rection—their words needled you and changed you, after all— but it’s possible the GM might shift you twice in the opposite direction if the fiction fits. It’s also possible that this causes you to <span class="s8">lose your balance</span>!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Remember that you can only <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">when an <i>NPC </i>tries to shift your balance. Usually this only hap- pens during regular play, when they say something to you—not as the result of another move. If another PC counsels you or challenges your thinking, they can try to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>
<a href="part66.htm#bookmark126" class="s22">you but you only shift your balance if they roll a 10+, or if you reject them in response. If an NPC shifts your balance during a combat exchange by Testing Your Balance (page 156),</a> you can’t <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance</span>. The rapid pace of an exchange means there isn’t enough time to reject or process the shift caused by any given technique.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Haki the Successor, played by Hector, has just finished fighting an impromptu Agni Kai against his childhood best friend turned rebel leader, Zo Jian.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Zo looks up at you, hurt in her eyes,&quot; says the GM. &quot;&#39;You always told me how you wanted to be someone different,&#39; she says as she gets to her knees. &#39;But you&#39;re just like the rest of your family.&#39; And then she hangs her head low in submission. She&#39;s definitely shifting your balance, toward Tradition, making yourself see how much like your family you really are.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Wait, isn&#39;t she saying it&#39;s a bad thing, though?&quot; asks Hector. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t she be shifting my balance away from Tradition?&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I see your point,&quot; says the GM. &quot;But if you want to play that you have a stunned reaction, horrified by the revelation, then that&#39;s probably you <b>resisting her shifting your balance</b>, not just accepting it.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Then I do that, I <b>resist her shifting my balance</b>! Do I add one of my principles to the roll?&quot; asks Hector.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Nope, just roll,&quot; says the GM. Hector rolls and gets a 10. &quot;I want to clear a condition by immediately acting to prove her wrong, and I&#39;ll shift my balance toward the opposite principle.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What do you do to prove her wrong?&quot; asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I reach out and carefully, kindly, gently lift her up. &#39;I&#39;m not like them,&#39; I say. &#39;I never wanted to fight you like this. I just wanted you to stop taking dangerous actions that might hurt other people. You can&#39;t let your rage define you as a leader; you have to seek peace, in all things.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, excellent! So you&#39;re proving you&#39;re different by <b>guiding and comforting </b>Zo Jian!&quot; says the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I didn&#39;t think of that, but yeah!&quot; says Hector.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Alright, clear your condition and shift your balance toward Progress, and then go ahead and roll with <span class="s49">Harmony </span>to <b>guide and comfort</b>!&quot;</p>

<a name="bookmark119">Lose Your Balance</a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If your balance shifts past the end of the track, you <b>lose your balance</b>. You obsess over that principle to a degree that’s not healthy for you or anyone around you. Choose one of the following:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Give in or submit to your opposition</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Lose control of yourself in a destructive and harmful way</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 5pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Take an extreme action in line with the principle, then flee Afterward, when you’ve had some time to recover and recen- ter yourself, shift your center one step towards the principle you exceeded and clear all your conditions and fatigue. Reset your balance to your new center.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you become more set in your ways and beliefs, you may find yourself leaning towards one principle more than another. This can be a good thing! Your firm belief in one of your principles makes it beneficial to <span class="s8">live up to your principle </span>when it really matters. However, you’re teetering on the edge of danger—you’ll have a hard time <span class="s8">denying a callout </span>on that strong principle, and if you shift your balance further, you <span class="s8">lose your balance</span>. When you do, you become so obsessed with that principle that you end up causing problems for yourself and others. You lose your balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can only <span class="s8">lose your balance </span>on-screen. In all cases, when you lose your balance, you are in some way removed from the action afterward. Sometimes you might flee. Sometimes you might fall unconscious. You might still be in the scene, but you’re not an active participant—you can’t respond to someone if they try to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>you, and you can’t trigger most moves or be proactive, at least not yet. It’s a bit like being taken out—you’re not an active agent until you’ve had some time to recover.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to <i>“give in or submit to your opposition,” </i>you’re so overcome by the principle that you’re overwhelmed and resign to giving up rather than resist further. If your opposition wants you to do something—instead of just surrendering—then choosing this option means you follow through on whatever they want you to do. In order to choose this option, you need opposition to give in to; you can’t give up or give in without any opposing force.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you <i>“lose control of yourself in a destructive and harmful way,” </i>your obsession with that principle causes you to lash out at the people and world around you. You might lose control of your fire- bending and erupt a burst of flame as you vent your frustration, or become so overcome with your belief in Progress that you destroy a priceless heirloom of your lineage. Whatever happens, something is destroyed or someone gets hurt (physically or emotionally).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you <i>“take an extreme action in line with the principle and flee,” </i>your temporary fixation on that principle means you do something drastic in pursuit of that belief. This is a catch-all for other kinds of extreme, intense actions you might take that show your overcom- mitment to your principle. Whatever you do has to be costly and consequential—it’s not extreme if you come out in more or less the same place on the other side. After you take the action, you flee the scene, and you can’t return—you’re out until the scene changes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If your <i>center </i>
<a href="part88.htm#bookmark170" class="s22">shifts past +3 or -3, then it might be time to change your playbook or retire your character. See page 219</a> for more on the ways your character’s story might shift dramatically.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;King looks at you with scorn in his eyes. The ground beneath him keeps shooting up little pebbles that enter orbit around him with each step—it&#39;s kind of intimidating. &#39;Not bad so far, kid, but I&#39;ve been taking it easy on you,&#39; he says. &#39;Run home to your friends before I actually start trying. You don&#39;t have what it takes to face me alone.&#39; He&#39;s shifting your balance away from center, which in your case means away from Confidence and towards Friendship.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;My balance goes off the edge,&quot; says Nadja. &quot;I <b>lose my balance</b>!&quot; &quot;That only happens at the end of the exchange, but since it&#39;s just</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">you and King and both of you have gone, it&#39;s the end of the ex- change right now! So you <b>lose your balance</b>, Nokkahak—in some way, you are out of the fight because what he says throws you off. Which of the options from the move do you pick?&quot; asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; says Nadja. &quot;I don&#39;t want to give in to him—he might just kill me! He&#39;s a pretty scary guy…&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;In this case, he&#39;s actually telling you to run back to your friends,&quot; says the GM. &quot;I&#39;m fine if giving in here means you run away.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;What would &#39;losing control of myself in a destructive or harmful way&#39; mean here? I&#39;m already trying to use my training to fight him and it&#39;s not going very well&quot; asks Nadja.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;It might not make a ton of sense for this situation,&quot; says the GM. &quot;If it doesn&#39;t, you should pick something else.&quot;</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Okay,&quot; says Nadja. &quot;Then I give in and flee! I run away to go find my friends!&quot;</p>
