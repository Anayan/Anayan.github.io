<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What About Bending?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">You’ll notice that aside from choosing which training you want during character creation and choosing any starting techniques, very little of the process of making a character for <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is about bending. That’s not an accident! Bending is a huge part of the game, but it might not show up in the way you expect…</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">A bending PC can use their bending in nearly any- thing they do. Their bending shows up when they rely on their skills and training to build an ice bridge, or when they trick an NPC by causing a pool of water off to the side to bubble, or when they guide and comfort someone by crafting a perfect ice flow- er as a gift. Their bending will be a huge part of how they participate in combat exchanges and how they interact with the fictional world as a whole.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">But when you think of a main character in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, you might think of their bending abilities first; yet the things that really make them special are about who they are, what they believe, and how they act. Aang is the Avatar, but he&#39;s also fun-loving, weighed down by responsibility, committed to helping people— saying only &quot;He can bend all four elements&quot; leaves so much of his character unspoken. Mako is a Fire- bender who can lightningbend, but he&#39;s also protec- tive, loyal, skeptical, and focused—saying only &quot;He&#39;s a Firebender&quot; doesn&#39;t really do him justice!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Every bending PC in <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is capable of impressive and awesome feats of bending, but the things that make them great characters for stories go well beyond their bending alone. The character creation process is designed to help your PCs come alive, so they can truly shine as the heroes of your own stories!</p>
