<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">If you’re struggling to develop a conflict, each era comes with five themes central to stories told in that era. Pick one of the themes to focus your adventure around. Those themes help anchor your adventure in the era you’re playing in, and there’s enough background in the setting for you to drive the action forward. Leaving the specifics of the conflict open means you allow your players to drive the action of the adventure. If you’re still struggling, remember: themes are also linked to each nation’s <i>Threats and Challenges</i>. You can use the conflicts we’ve presented there for adventures as well!</p>

<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The conflict between those who wish to punish the general here and those who wish to send him back to Republic City for trial comes to a boiling point. Some decide to take matters into their own hands, meting out a sentence on the general now, before anyone can take him away from the village. As they approach the prison, other villagers stand in their way. The two sides erupt into a vicious, loud, angry argument, which devolves rapidly into an actual fight. A few Earthbenders break into the general’s windowless cell, but as the general tries to escape in the chaos, someone encases the general in stone, accidentally killing him in the heat of the moment and ending the fight. Both sides, stunned at the sudden violence of what’s happened, start to drift away from the village, no longer sure they can trust their neighbors. The perpetrator is rapidly hidden from retribution, as well.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above example has a lot of unanswered questions: how did the village capture this general? Are the general’s allies coming to rescue him? How can the players convince the village to spare this man? All of these questions might come into play as the com- panions interact with the conflict, but—if they choose to remain distant—you’re prepared to let things play out on their own…</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How do twists and ties deepen conflict?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you have time before the session, you can also <span class="s20">plan a twist to your conflict</span>. The Avatarverse is complex, and most conflicts are based around the tension between balance and imbalance. A twist in the adventure complicates the conflict even further, both draw- ing players closer to it and pushing them away from easy answers.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Twist</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The general hid in the village because his daughter also lives there. Instead of plotting revenge, the general tried to live peacefully with her and his granddaughter, forsaking all violence once he saw what his work as a member of the Earth Empire did to the lives of the peo- ple. He didn’t even resist when the locals discovered who he was and apprehended him. Should the companions even consider taking him to Republic City when he’s clearly trying to turn over a new leaf and live a quiet, peaceful life helping this town and his family?</p>
