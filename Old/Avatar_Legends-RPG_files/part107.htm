<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First Adventures</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">You don’t have to prepare an entire adventure before you start playing, but you want to have a good conflict in mind as well as a few NPCs. You can read more about preparing adventures in <b>Chapter 10: Running Adventures</b>, but remember that you’re <i>playing to find out what happens</i>! It’s okay to discover some of the adventure, including the major antago- nists and details of the conflict, alongside the PCs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">During the First Session</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Character creation usually eats up a fair amount of time in the first session—sometimes even as much as two hours—but even when it takes a while to get through introductions (and all your questions!), you usually have time to start the companions off with a new episode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your goals for the first session are simple:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Set up a conflict that draws in the companions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Show off the Avatarverse and these new heroes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Go through the mechanics of the game</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Create an awesome episode of your campaign</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone has finished creating their characters, take a break and prepare an opening conflict to draw the PCs into the story. You might use an existing adventure that fits your group, but for a campaign, it’s often a better idea for your first episode to draw upon whatever conflict the players decided on as their group focus. For example, if they’ve chosen to “defeat a danger- ous foe,” then you may start them off with a conflict and story that gives them a chance to advance that goal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If possible, you also want your first session to hit the follow- ing mechanics:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Every basic move, including <span class="s8">help a companion</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Balance shifts, <span class="s8">living up to a principle</span>, and</p>
<p class="s8" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resisting shifting your balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Conditions, taking them and removing them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Combat, including the <span class="s8">stance move </span>and statuses</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to showcasing the mechanics, you might want to try the following during that first session as well:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Ask questions constantly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Bring the action</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Build on character creation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Call out moves as they happen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Invoke the era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Offer moves when players flinch</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Shift their balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Test their training</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ask questions constantly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Never stop asking for more details throughout the whole first session. Any time a question occurs to you about the fiction, ask it. “What happens to the bandits when you bring them back to the city?” “Why did you decide this outpost was the right one to attack?” “Who trained you to use your swords to scale stone walls?” Every answer gives you something new to build upon, a new idea you can bring into play right away…or something you can save for later, as you think about the rest of your campaign.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bring the action</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rather than spend a lot of time setting up and hoping the players get to the conflict, throw the companions into the middle of an interesting situation. Perhaps they are sneaking into the villain’s headquarters or attacking a particular holding the villain uses often; start off in the middle of the action and figure out the plan as you go! <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is about cool heroes taking action to make the world a better place <i>right now</i>, not after they’ve held an hour-long planning session about how they are undertaking some action and adventure.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Build on character creation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The more you reincorporate elements the players introduced during character creation, the better. Try to include several NPCs or factions the players mentioned when introducing their char- acters, and take every opportunity—even when the companions are on the run or in strange situations—to tie the first session to everything the players have told you about their characters. After all, it’s far better for the companions to face an NPC antagonist they established in their introduction than for you to invent a brand-new character to whom they have no attachment.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Call out moves as they happen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Look for opportunities to show off the basic moves; any time a player triggers one, call it out to them, asking, “It sounds like you’re trying to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>, right?” At the start of play, players need a bit of help recognizing when they’ve triggered a move or which move they’ve triggered. Don’t force them into a particular action—they</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">can always say “No, that’s not quite what I want to do…”—but mod- el for them what it looks like to move from actions in the fiction to the mechanics of the game and then back to the fiction. If players try to trigger moves without fiction, help them out there too: “I’d love to see you <span class="s8">intimidate </span>this guard! What does that look like?”</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Invoke the era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No matter how you set up the initial situation, make sure that you get to the heart of the conflicts you and your players have decided to focus on. Every era has many conflicts it can repre- sent, but you discussed with your group the tone and emphasis for your game—so bring that out during play! For example, the GM for a group that decides to emphasize political intrigue in the Roku Era might reveal that someone close to the compan- ions has betrayed them to advance a political goal; a group that decides to focus on post-war recovery in the Aang Era might encounter tensions boiling to the surface that threaten a fragile peace. Nothing is simple in the Avatarverse; complicate the situ- ation in a way that makes the PCs think hard about their values!</p>

<a name="bookmark200">Offer moves when players flinch</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, don’t tell players what to do—leave their actions up to them. But in this first session, offer suggestions about moves they might make, especially when they seem hesitant. Always phrase it as a question rooted in the fiction—“You’re a Waterbender, right? Do you want to <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>to slide down from the top of the building on a stream of ice? Or maybe you want to <span class="s8">intimidate </span>these thugs with a show of force?” Often players go for a third option of their own creation, but your little push can get them thinking about what they really want to do.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Shift their balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From the very start of play, have NPCs try to shift the bal- ance of the companions. Have the villains tell them who they are—“You’re just a weapon, aren’t you? Trained to hurt those</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">who disagree with you…”—and have their allies remind them of the consequences of their actions—“I can’t believe you stood up for me. I’ve never seen such loyalty.” <span class="s8">Call them out </span>as well, less frequently than mere shifts in their balance, but regularly enough to remind them that they can <span class="s8">call an NPC out </span>as well.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Test their training</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, always give the PCs a chance to show off their awesome abilities, both by presenting challenges that their trainings can solve—“The bridge is out! How do you get across?”—and by confronting them with antagonists itching for a fight. The <span class="s8">stance move </span>and statuses do most of the work of managing the fight for you, but take some time to push the players to explain how their fighting style shows up every time they fight. An Earthbender who creates rock walls and large obstacles creates different statuses, different effects in the fiction, and inflicts different con- ditions than a combatant who armors themselves in stone and charges into the fight!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">After the First Session</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve finished the first session, start to think about where things might go from here. You’ve probably got a good idea of who the PCs are and what they care about, and you’ve already started to develop a roster of NPCs to bring into the story to keep it moving. And don’t forget the consequences of whatever the players did in the first session! Often, whatever happens in the first session becomes a critical part of the narra- tive moving forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Let all these elements percolate; you can use them to build out a whole season of stories for your group—not by planning the full plot of each story, but by using everything your group built in the first session as hooks for the adventures and episodes that happen next!</p>
