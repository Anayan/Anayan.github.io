<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WhAT IS AN ATTACK?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Many special techniques reference attacks, such as “whenever you <i>attack</i>” or “a character who <i>attacked </i>you this exchange.” In all cases, an attack is any aggressive, physical move against a target</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">during an exchange that attempts to directly inflict a condition, fatigue, balance shifts, or negative status. Actions that indirectly harm a target, such as smashing the ground beneath someone or trying to trap someone under a tree are not attacks, even if they inflict fatigue or a status like <i>Trapped</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Results of the Training Move</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“On a hit, you learn the technique and your master shifts your balance” <span class="p">means that you take the technique at learned level, and your mas- ter can shift your balance in whichever direction they choose— taking up their lessons does shift your balance at least a bit.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark two conditions” <span class="p">gives you a hard choice. If you mark two conditions, you come out of the training emotionally frustrated or thrown, but successful. If you take more time than normal, how- ever, you’re handing the GM a golden opportunity to make a GM move, to say that something happens while you’re busy training that you can’t affect, stop, or interfere with. It might leave you out of a fight that embroils your fellow companions; it might be some- thing terrible happening to the local town. Be prepared!</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">“On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need an- other lesson before you can grasp its full use” <span class="p">means exactly that— you can’t complete your training right here, right now, without additional effort. </span>“Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, and you learn the technique” <span class="p">means that your master will give you some other duty or task. That task takes you on a journey, changing your mind and leading you to new understanding, but allowing you to actually learn the technique in full. As soon as you complete the task, you get the technique at learned level, but the GM is the arbiter of whether or not the task is complete.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the GM assigns you a task, it relates in some way to the nature of the technique, and the lessons the teacher might have to teach about the world, people, and balance. It doesn’t have to be as complicated as a mastery condition (see below)—it’s usu- ally something you can do within a session—but that framework can be useful for thinking about appropriate tasks.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Tasks:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Apologize to another player character, honestly and truly, for some wrongdoing</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Work to aid, help, or save an NPC who desperately needs it</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Journey to a nearby location of spiritual or historical prominence, and study it or meditate on it</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Obtain a local resource and deliver it to the teacher or another NPC</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Agree with the teacher, honestly, about some rule or restriction on future action</p>

<a name="bookmark166">Improving Techniques</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part62.htm#bookmark123" class="s22">After you have learned a technique—marking it on your play- book at learned level—you can now use it in combat exchanges, but only if you roll a 10+ on the stance move (page 148)</a> and mark an additional fatigue. Those are some high bars! The good news, however, is that you can improve your control and ability to use the technique. You can take your learned technique and make it practiced; and you can take your practiced technique and master it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But improving techniques requires you to do some work on your own! While learning a technique requires you to find a teacher willing to train you, advancing your knowledge further requires you to go beyond direct instruction, practicing the technique during combat exchanges and (eventually) working to understand the technique at a new level through the mastery conditions your teacher sets for you.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Going from Learned to Practiced</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To take your technique from learned level to practiced level, you have to use it once—just once!—in combat. That means rolling a 10+ on the <span class="s8">stance move</span>, and paying the additional cost of 1-fa- tigue (beyond any cost the technique itself might impose). But as soon as you’ve done that once, the technique is at practiced level. That means you’ve used it and you can call on it imme- diately, even in the very next combat exchange—not with the same simple ease as a mastered technique, but more easily than at learned. A practiced technique can be used when you roll a 10+ on the <span class="s8">stance move</span>, without paying any additional cost.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Going from Practiced to Mastered</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To take your technique from practiced level to mastered level, you have to overcome a higher bar. You have to fulfill a mastery condition, as set to you by your teacher. A mastery condition is a special task to teach you a further lesson, to help you shift your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mind and balance to a place where you can gain total control and mastery over the particular technique you’re focused on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To learn what your mastery condition must be for the technique, you must have a teacher—you have to have someone to guide you. Your mastery condition is also specifically <i>yours</i>. Every mastery con- dition is suited to the technique, the teacher, and the student. The condition represents what the teacher thinks the student must learn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most of the time, you can get a mastery condition as soon as you learn the technique. Usually, the GM assigns you just such a mastery condition after you have successfully taken the tech-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nique at learned level. But you can also get the mastery condition later, especially from more crotchety, ornery teachers who prefer you master the basics (i.e. go from learned to practiced level) before they even tell you the mastery condition. No matter what, however, a teacher, specifically, sets the mastery condition—and a different teacher might set a different mastery condition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Setting a mastery condition requires the GM to think about the PC, the teacher, and what the teacher might want the character to learn, especially in context of this particular technique. A tech- nique about overwhelming, defeating power taught by a quiet, unassuming monk to a brash, aggressive Hammer might lead the teacher to ask the Hammer to submit, to surrender to a dangerous foe—the lesson of defeat is crucial for the student to understand how to use that force on a foe. A technique about evasive action taught by a master thief to a boisterous, fun-loving Icon might lead the teacher to ask the Icon to purposefully make others angry with them, and then to escape from those dangerous situations—the lesson of ever-more-difficult, ever-more-dangerous evasion push- ing the student to understand how to get away from trouble.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">GMs should think about the following when setting a mas-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">tery condition:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• What are the PC’s principles, and how does the teacher see them? If the teacher sees the character as too far one way or the other on the balance track, the teacher could set them a mastery condition to push the other way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What does the player character care about? If the teacher thinks the character cares too much about the wrong thing, or too little about the right thing, the teacher can set them a mastery condition that pushes them to change their priorities.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What is the PC’s personality like? If the character is too much of one thing (too aggressive, too quiet, too afraid, too serious), the teacher might set them a mastery condition that pushes them to act differently, to feel differently.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, nearly any task can be a good mastery condition, just so long as it’s interesting and leads to fun new stories; it relates to the PC specifically, connecting to their issues and sources of drama; and it’s a challenge to accomplish, but certainly not impossible.</p>

<a name="bookmark167">Example Mastery Conditions:</a>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Defeat a specific foe in combat</b>—useful for when the player character would otherwise run from that foe or has difficulty standing up for themselves. <i>Example: Defeat the leader of the Red Ribbon Bandits, who destroyed your home.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Surrender</b>—useful for when the PC is bold or overly brave and needs to learn a lesson in humility. Add “to a specific foe” to push them to a particular enemy they only ever want to fight. <i>Example: Surrender to the Chief of Police</i>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of Republic City and face them with head held high.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Lose your balance</b>—useful for an overly careful player character, who never loses their balance, whose center has not shifted over many sessions of play. Add “in a specific situation” to make it more directed. <i>Example: Lose your balance in an argument with a powerful figure.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Be taken out</b>—useful for when the PC always deals with their conditions before they can threaten to overwhelm them, when they need to learn not to run from their feelings. Add “in a specific situation” to make it more directed. <i>Example: Be taken out outside of combat.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Seek a specific mystical or ancient location</b>—useful for when the overall group of companions travels quite a bit, and when the technique is strange or draws on lost wisdom. <i>Example: Seek the Sun Warriors in their hidden city and learn from them.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Return an important artifact to its proper place</b>—useful for when the player character doesn’t attach to places</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">or the people in them, and needs to learn a lesson about preservation and protection. <i>Example: Return the spirit tome to its place of prominence in the Eastern Air Temple.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Find and listen to an opposing teacher</b>—useful for when the teacher presents a highly polarized view of the world, and the PC needs to learn the lessons at the opposing end of the spectrum. <i>Example: Find the only other student of the same teacher and let them complete your training.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• <b>Build a structure of spiritual or local import</b>—useful for when the player character is much more of a fighter or a destroyer, or even an evader who tends to run from problems, than a builder who constructs. Add “with/without using particular tools”</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">to make it more poignant or challenging. <i>Example: Construct defenses around the whole of the village without your bending.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Destroy a dangerous or corrupt structure</b>—useful for when the PC is more prone to careful, comforting, pleasant, harmonious solutions, and refuses to solve problems, even intractable ones, by bowling them over. <i>Example: Destroy the local polluting factory.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Tell a specific person a specific, difficult truth</b>—useful for when the player character’s issues have a lot to do with making decisions, or trying to hide things about themselves. <i>Example: Admit to your other teachers that you, an Icon, don’t want to fulfill your Role.</i>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• <b>Use the technique in an exchange in a particular way</b>— useful for when the player character is reluctant to make use of an advanced technique or when the technique</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">is particularly powerful or focused. <i>Example: Defeat an opponent using this technique as the final blow.</i>
