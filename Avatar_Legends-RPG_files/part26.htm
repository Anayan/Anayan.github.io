		<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roku Era specifically details the time between Sozin’s coronation and Avatar Roku’s wedding. The world is currently in an unprecedented time of peace, though minor skirmishes still occur between the Four Nations. This peace is in part due to Roku being an extremely competent Avatar, the Air Nomads keeping the peace internationally, and the diplomatic work that keeps disputes from boiling over into open war.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">During this era, the Four Nations see most conflict on the political field where they jockey for political power and resourc- es. Academic and industrial institutions churn out a number</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of new technologies, which each nation’s government wants to produce and exploit. The nations vie for resources to produce these valuable inventions, resulting in numerous small-scale or diplomatic conflicts.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s20">Air Nomads </span>do their best to keep peace on an internation- al scale, by lending aid when requested by the other nations or the Avatar himself. However, they also face their own problems with</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a renegade order called the Guiding Wind. The Guiding Wind be- lieves the Air Nomads have grown complacent in their search for enlightenment and seek too much cooperation with the corrupt and exploitative wealthy citizens of other nations. Many Elders denounce the Guiding Wind for their disruptive actions. With the Air Nomads being pulled in so many different directions, it seems to only be a matter of time before the stresses overwhelm them and they’re spread too thin to help everyone.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Guiding Wind is also active in the <span class="s20">Fire Nation </span>where</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">young nobility embrace Air Nomad philosophy. This movement is in part led by Fire Lord Sozin’s sister, Zeisan, who intends to swear off her earthly possessions in exchange for a life of aus- terity. But the Air Nomads and his sister are just two problems the new Fire Lord intends to tackle. After bringing the warring families of the Fire Nation to heel, the Fire Lord has made great strides towards progress in his country. Instituting new plans</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to uplift the poorest of the nation and starting the tradition of dragon hunting to assert his dominance, Sozin’s legacy as Fire Lord looks promising indeed.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sozin’s actions are in stark contrast to those of the <span class="s20">Earth Kingdom </span>monarch Jialun who dedicates a large amount of his time undoing the constitution set out by his predecessors. First, the Earth King dissolved the Earth Sage order, unseating</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">his most vocal opponents. Then, he overturned old laws and instated new ones to consolidate his power. Some pockets of the Earth Kingdom suffer under the new laws, but others willing to play the Earth King’s game have flourished.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Water Tribes </span>in this era work with one another to secure trade routes and grow the prosperity of their people. Though the Northern Water Tribe chief and the Southern Water Tribe chiefs often disagree on how to solve issues, they present a united front to the rest of the world, making them real players on the international stage. Unfortunately, many worry all their work may be for naught if they cannot appease the spirits who seem agitated by the technolog- ical innovations—and looming conflicts—of this new age.</p>

		<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Roku</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Roku grew up as a Fire Nation noble and the best friend of Prince Sozin. Roku spent much of his time visiting the Royal Palace and never wanted for much of anything in his life. He was a kind, determined, and friendly child. When Roku turned 16, he was identified as the Avatar, and before he left on his journey to master the elements, his dear friend Sozin gave him the Fire Nation’s Crown Prince headpiece as a sign of their friendship.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Roku traveled the world for years learning to master the ele- ments and he made a few good friends along the way including Monk Gyatso and the master Waterbender Taqukaq. Through his travels Roku learned many things about the world. He saw how unique each nation was and how their peace was held to- gether by fragile threads. He learned what it was like for people living in poverty and realized what his privilege afforded him in his youth. Traveling the nations wasn’t just about learning the elements for Roku; it was about understanding the world and his important duties as Avatar.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These lessons were driven home when his impatient need to master the Avatar State caused the destruction of the Crescent Island Temple. Since then, Roku’s been cautious and subtle in his actions and takes his duties very seriously. He is a highly competent Avatar who has helped to avert numerous interna- tional incidents over the years with the help of many close allies from the Four Nations, especially Air Nomads.</p>

	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">It’s a time of collaboration. Prosperous conditions have turned citizens’ attention outward, and new technologies bridge the distance between the nations. Roku’s work as Avatar focuses on fostering this international collaboration and stifling conflicts before they break into war. People look for new solutions to im- prove lives and seek connections with other cultures to better understand the world. But some resist the growing cooperation. These isolationists believe things were better before the na- tions interacted so often, and that more distance between the nations eliminates the risk of terrible conflict. Those who seek greater integration view the isolationists as needlessly cautious and afraid, seeking to put off a future all but inevitable.</p>

	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Leaders manipulate those around them and blame issues on outside influences, sometimes out of honest belief, sometimes to build their powerbase. In the ever-more-connected world, it’s difficult to tell when a problem like local poverty is genuinely</p>
	<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">an outgrowth of contact between peoples, and when such con- flicts are just a useful scapegoat for the wealthy and powerful. A leader could truly believe outsiders are a corrupting influ- ence when they blame problems with a renegade spirit on the destructive practices of a visiting group from another nation.</p>
	<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">However, some use the actions of other peoples to distract from their own nefarious deeds—a local fishing magnate can easily blame polluted waters on ships from another nation.</p>
	<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
	<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Blame issues on outsiders</p>

	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The world is experiencing a renaissance of ideas and creativity, which goes hand in hand with industrialization. As more of the world starts to develop new technologies, the need for resourc- es is an issue. The various nations squabble over territory that allows them to get the goods they need. In the meantime other parties, like members of the Water Tribes and Air Nomads, worry about how this rapid progress affects the spirits. Agitated spirits now roam forests around the poles—could all this new technology be the reason? Or perhaps the conflicts over the resources themselves are to blame?</p>
	<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
	<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Ignore a spiritual concern in favor of technology</p>

	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">As the world becomes more globally integrated people ask themselves—do we pull together or break apart? As the Four Nations begin to collaborate more, people wonder how much is too much? In order to answer the above questions, they test</p>
	<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">their alliances with one another. They try to get as much as they can for themselves, without angering another too much. Some do this to test the loyalty of their allies, but others do it for personal gain. They exploit the weaknesses they see and stoke conflicts between other parties to take the heat off themselves.</p>
	<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>

	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Outright wars are rare. Sometimes members of two nations may get into a skirmish, but it’s never anything close to a “war.” This era is a time of peace and most people want to keep it this way. Many trade in secrets to keep this uneasy peace between</p>
	<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">nations, resorting to blackmail rather than diplomacy to get their way. Leaders use propaganda to instill unwavering loyalty in their followers, while also taking questionable clandestine action. Every person and nation has secrets and the only question is—how can they use them for their own benefit before someone else does?</p>

	</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is a list of important events, which occur leading up to and during this era. Each event has a list of the current consequences for stories in this era.</p>
	<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Night of Silenced Sages</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
		<a href="part28.htm#bookmark51" class="s22">When Roku had only just begun his journey to master the four elements, the Earth Kingdom experienced a seismic change no one dared acknowledge—the end of the Earth Sage order. The Earth Sages were weakened since Kyoshi’s time and the sages of this era looked to right the wrongs of their past. Though fewer in number, they worked as scholars lecturing on how to expand the bureaucratic channels to benefit the poorest in society. And they spoke out against Earth King Jialun’s (page 54)</a> changes to the constitution Kyoshi and the 46<span class="s45">th </span>Earth King drafted.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Then, in a single night, Jialun sent out Dai Li agents to round up every last Earth Sage. No one knew where they went and those who dared look for the sages disappeared as well. By the end of the week, the people learned to remain silent about the sages. Then, the Earth Sage temples re-opened, re-branded as Royal Learning Halls. A scant few of those who disappeared returned…not as sages, but Grand Lectors, keepers of these new halls, forswearing any connection to the Earth Sage tradition.</p>
		<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
		<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• There are no known Earth Sages left in the Earth Kingdom.</p>
		<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Royal Learning Halls are heavily monitored by the crown.</p>
		<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Earth King has little organized outspoken internal opposition.</p>

		<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Northern Passage</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For years, the Northern Water Tribe and the northern Earth Kingdom state of Chenbao have been embroiled in a dispute over local fishing and trade routes. Both nations have engaged in minor skirmishes and militarized the waters in-between as a show of force. A massive tsunami swept through those waters and struck the northern coast of Chenbao, nearly setting off a military conflict between the two sides. Chenbao blamed Wa- terbenders for sending the tsunami, while the Northern Water Tribe blamed Earthbenders for creating an underwater earth- quake. The truth is that both sides suffered losses from a natural disaster—the tsunami destroyed several Earth Kingdom towns <i>and </i>completely wrecked a Northern Water Tribe fleet. Greater tragedy was averted when Avatar Roku—supported by several airbending masters from the Northern Air Temple—intervened before a full-scale war broke out. Though both sides backed down, their navies remain in the waters ready to act at the first sign of wrongdoing from the other side. And the conflict is on</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a path back to greater tension as the governor of Chenbao now tries to tax any Water Tribe goods or ships traveling through these waters…</p>
		<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
		<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Relations between the Northern Water Tribe and the Earth Kingdom are poor.</p>
		<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The waters between the Earth Kingdom and the Northern Water Tribe are functionally blockaded by both sides.</p>
		<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Air Nomads remain active in the region to keep a tenuous peace.</p>
		<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Destruction of the Crescent Island Fire Temple <a href="part27.htm#bookmark46" class="s22">After his stint in the Earth Kingdom mastering earthbending, Roku returned home to master the Avatar State. Using the power of the winter solstice sun to enhance his abilities, Roku entered the Avatar State, but couldn’t control his powers. He accidentally destroyed the Crescent Island Fire Temple and caused an erup- tion in a nearby volcano. Thanks to the help of Fire Sage Kaja (page 49),</a>
		<span class="p"> Roku regained control of himself, but the damage was already done.</span>
	</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Roku has now rebuilt the temple for the sages, but the island region still faces seismic instability thanks to the now-active vol- cano. Many remote villages struggle with rebuilding in the face of earthquakes and the Fire Sages fear it is just a matter of time before the volcano erupts again. Many villagers wish to relocate to other parts of the Fire Nation given the relentless seismic activity, but there are few places they can go. The Fire Lord has sent aid to the villages, but as the officials of his government have explained that’s all he can do—as the Fire Nation doesn’t have plentiful empty land—unlike the Earth Kingdom.</p>
	<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
	<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Crescent Island and surrounding islands still deal with seismic instability.</p>
	<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Avatar Roku has become a more restrained and thoughtful Avatar.</p>
	<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Anti-Earth Kingdom sentiment grows in the outlying islands affected by seismic activity as their neighbor has neither sent benders to aid them nor offered them a place to shelter.</p>

	<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Air Nomad philosophy’s growing influence in the Fire Nation has led to Fire Nation citizens building a place to teach Air Nomad culture in the Fire Nation. This center is funded by a select group of Fire Nation nobles who’ve embraced Air Nomad teachings and pushed for a partnership between both nations. While the Air No- mads hesitated at first, all four temples eventually supported the idea—as a way to forge peace and cooperation between nations.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
		<a href="part27.htm#bookmark48" class="s22">The Guiding Wind, a group of Air Nomads who believe the “corrupt” nobles are leading the Air Nomads away from spiritual enlightenment, have sabotaged the construction on numerous occasions in protest. In response, Fire Lord Sozin seized control of the building site from the nobility and entrenched his loyal military guard to protect the local population. Sozin won’t remove his guard until the Guiding Wind leaves and the Guiding Wind has no plans on halting their sabotage until the construction ends completely; see more on the Guiding Wind on page 51.</a>

	<a name="bookmark44">Dragon Hunts</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seizing the Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning eroded Sozin’s political support. In a show of his power as Fire Lord, and wanting to ap- pear more fearsome than his father, he began the Dragon Hunts. So far, only a few dragons have been found and killed, but the no- bility embrace this new sport with a voracious appetite. Whoever finds and slays a dragon gains the honorary title of Dragon from the crown and increases (as per rumor) their firebending abilities a thousand-fold. These hunts earn Sozin loyalty amongst the no- bility who enjoy the prestige the extra title grants and the ability to one-up their competitors. Those with greater historical or spiritual awareness, such as the Fire Sages, struggle with the murder of ancient creatures with such a deep connection to firebending.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The imbalance created by killing these magnificent creatures has already shown up in the natural world. Spirits are drawn to the locations where dragons are slain and strange occurrences seem to haunt the area. Sozin has formed an elite taskforce to deal with these occurrences and keep them under wraps from the general population.</p>

<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Dragons either hide or strike first against the humans hunting them.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Nobles and spiritual leaders disagree on the morality of the Dragon Hunts.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• The hunts are creating imbalance with the spiritual world.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During this era, new technological institutes and universities spring up around the world—scholars, inventors, and educators directly forge connections with one another in the name of progress. It’s a time of unprecedented collaboration fostered by business and academia to solve the era’s most pressing concerns. The <i>Unity </i>
	<a href="part28.htm#bookmark49" class="s22">seafaring vessel is a joint venture funded by the busi- ness magnate Tiqriganiannig (often called Tiq; page 52)</a> with various learning institutes across the world. It was built within the past year or so with the accumulated knowledge of these technological institutes. Now, the <i>Unity </i>embarks on a year-long world trek to visit all the different nations, sharing their studies and technology in a gesture of togetherness. Unfortunately, near- ly all the ruling bodies of the world (and a few rivals of Tiq) wish to stop the voyage! The governments tend to view the <i>Unity </i>as a trick, an attempt to deploy spies all over the world; Tiq’s rivals, on the other hand, are simply jealous of the <i>Unity</i>’s success and want to see the massive ship sunk.</p>
	<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>

	<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The <i>Unity</i>’s Grand Tour sees the ship traveling all over the world carrying people of import.</p>
	<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The tour is slowed by constant sabotage and bureaucratic roadblocks.</p>
