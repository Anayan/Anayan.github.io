</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bending—mystically controlling the elements—is a pillar of the Avatarverse. The word “bender” is literally in the first story set in the world: <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game <span class="p">doesn’t include “spell lists” or specific, rule-based ways to use bending talents. Bending the elements is more freeform. Let players infuse their creativity and personality in their character’s bending. Say “yes” to interesting, unusual bending ideas, even if you haven’t seen it portrayed in the source media. Remember this is a fiction-first system—always couched in terms of what is actually happening in the fiction. Play- ers should tell you what they’re trying to achieve through bending and what their characters are actually attempting.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ensure that you maintain <i>some </i>sort of internal consistency with regards to power levels, simply to avoid confusion (“Well I froze the whole army in place with waterbending last time so why not this time?”). However, when in doubt, call for a move to resolve the uncertainty. Besides, in the Avatarverse, people often show greater-than-normal capabilities under exceptional, one-off circumstances or periods of heightened emotion or unique environmental characteristics. You can always chalk up incredible, game-breaking displays of power to something like that (“It was the stress! Or a strange comet!”),</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">especially thanks to status effects like <i>Em- powered</i>. Ultimately, follow the agen-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">das, baselines, and guide- lines, keeping everyone’s enjoyment at the forefront, and you should be fine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, combat is a lit- tle more constrained in this game. Remind players that the chaos of a fight requires focus and discipline. This</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is why combat techniques, which have specific effects, need to be learned, practiced, and mastered. Basic combat techniques often leave open the specifics of what you’re ac- tually doing, so players can and should still express creativity through those; but combat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is never as open-ended as regular play.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Role of Training</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don’t forget that growth is only one form of advancement; the companions can also become stronger benders and better warriors by mastering additional techniques through training.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Learning and mastering advanced techniques for combat is a great motivator, both for companions and the players who</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">control them: within a story, companions want to deepen their skills, while players want to try out cool new abilities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wanting to learn advanced techniques might be the reason companions seek out ancient scrolls in old temples, or search for knowledgeable masters hidden in the world. Bending teachers can be found in many places and may not always look like what you might expect. Showcase NPCs’ advanced techniques and remind players that these techniques can be learned by studying with these characters (even “villains” can have a change of heart and teach companions—look at Prince Zuko!).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Learning and mastering advanced techniques should take time and effort. Use them as rewards for achieving goals in the story. Base the conditions for mastering a technique on the character attempting the technique and the lessons they must learn. These lessons need not be training-specific. A PC may need to shift their balance, demonstrate a specific personality trait, or come to understand some fundamental truth in order to master a technique. In short, use mastery as another way to further a character’s arc.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: left;">Always remember that when a PC rolls a 7–9 on the training move and chooses to have their training take time—instead</p>
<p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">of marking two conditions—they are giving you a golden opportunity! Make a move that increases the tension and maximizes drama: perhaps <i>the odds shift suddenly </i>in a conflict they aren’t attending to or you <i>reveal a hidden truth </i>about their teacher’s real motivations and loyalties. The choice to spend more time training instead of just marking the conditions should have an impact on the fiction!</p>
