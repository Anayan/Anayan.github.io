<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s Lost</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">What is the Singing Path? Who is Róng? What other spiritual sites are the Air Nomads losing? These specifics are up to you and your game. None of the sites the Air Nomads protect in this era make it to the Roku Era and the Nomads know they’re fighting a losing battle. Stories you tell surrounding these sites engage the theme of Loss and Abandonment from the unique perspective of the Air Nomads. A player who chooses to portray an Air Nomad in this era must balance their spiritual duty and their nat- ural inclination to travel and explore. The tragedy of the Air Nomads in this era is that while they are accused of not caring about the outside world, they in fact care very deeply. So deeply that they often must ignore worldly concerns to focus on preserv- ing spiritual knowledge for generations to come.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Much of which, we as fans of the Avatarverse know, is sadly lost during the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyemtsen</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Air Nun fighting her secret desire to exact revenge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyemtsen is an Air Nun from the Eastern Air Temple. She left her position as a sought-after airbending teacher to protect the Singing Path after her sister died protecting it. The Singing Path is a spiritual site in the Earth Kingdom guarded by a spirit named</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Róng and is now corrupted by a <i>daofei </i>group known as the Ghost Tigers using it as a hideout. Thanks to continued harassment by the Ghost Tigers, Róng now wishes to pull her home into the Spirit World, but can’t do it while they’re still there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Ever since her sister’s death at the hands of the Ghost Tigers, Gyemtsen struggles with urges to exact vengeance, urges that vi- olate the ethics of the Air Nomads. She chases the Ghost Tigers through the winding stones of the Singing Path and steers them away from neighboring towns…while inching ever closer to the idea that if she can’t find a way to remove them from the Singing Path peacefully, she will do it by force.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mangal</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A restless soul in tune with the spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mangal is a troublemaker (at least by Air Nomad standards) who lives in the Northern Air Temple. He has snuck away from the Northern Air Temple many times before and used to play tricks on the Air Monks as a kid. Though few know it, Mangal is very good at spirit projecting and communicating with spirits. He can even solve problems in nearby villages just by sensing what is causing the spirits distress and helping to fix it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Mangal is contemplating running away from the temple for good since he’s so misunderstood. He knows the surrounding area well, including places where local <i>daofei </i>frequent. Heroes with spirit problems or issues with local <i>daofei </i>would find a useful guide in Mangal, but he does have a tendency to get into trouble.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protecting the Avatar Relics</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Law and Order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the Air Nomads’ responsibilities is to protect the relics used to help identify the Avatar. These relics are a collection of four toys (a stuffed hog-monkey, a clay turtle-duck, a drum, and a whirligig) that belonged to past incarnations of the Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When testing children to see if they are potentially the Avatar, the relics get mixed with a wide variety of random toys. The Air Nomads display the toys in front of the children, and if one of them chooses the correct ones, it indicates that the child has memories of their past lives as the Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Very early in this era, the toys were stolen by an air monk named Kelsang to expedite the search for the Avatar, highlighting the relics’ vulnerability. Though Kelsang returned the relics when he was finished with them, the Air Monks worry about them be- ing stolen again by outsiders or traitors. Other parties may want to steal the relics for nefarious reasons, which would be a devastating loss for the Air Nomads. For instance, a wealthy antiquarian might hire a thief to steal a relic for his collection, or an Air Nomad who wants to create a new sect might take them as leverage.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exile</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Loss and Abandonment</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads on the whole value pacifism and emotional detachment, so when one of their own engages in violence or reckless behavior there are consequences. Kelsang, Kyoshi’s late adoptive father and an Air Monk, was exiled from the Southern Air Temple after he destroyed a Fifth Nation splinter fleet and stole the Avatar relics. Airbenders who follow his example are likely to find themselves in exile as well, and it is not easy to get back in the Air Nomads’ good graces.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Air Nomads who turn from their people’s teachings and face exile may band together and explore the world. Perhaps, they do not denounce violence when it is used to defend innocent peo- ple. Many elders condemn this selfishness, claiming that it only serves to divide the Air Nomads and ignores the spiritual duties each Nomad has. This embrace of freedom is growing, however, and there is little the Elders can do to stop it.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Criticism of Philosophy</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Harmony Without, Turmoil Within</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the Air Nomads highly value peace, pacifism, and detach- ment, they often do not get involved with conflicts taking place outside their bubble. That said, many Air Nomads involve them- selves in spiritual matters no matter what nation they are in. This can lead to people in the region they visit resenting the Nomads for their focus on their own personal goals and the spirits, rather than the people standing right in front of them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Air Nomads are likely to face these types of criticisms when traveling throughout the world, or they may feel similarly about their people’s philosophy themselves. When arriving in a new area, Air Nomads may be refused entrance even if they’re there to solve a matter with spirits. Likewise, Nomad infighting on whether they should help people outside their nation could hinder a group’s mission, despite everyone’s best intentions.</p>

</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">kyoshi era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part15.htm#bookmark27" class="s22">The startling differences between the Northern and Southern Wa- ter Tribes are never more apparent than during the Kyoshi Era. The Southern Water Tribe has suffered economically for some time, which has resulted in many people leaving to pursue a life of piracy instead. The Southern capital, Wolf Cove (page 21),</a> was once much larger, but it has been steadily shrinking in population as people move from the city to villages upon the open ice to provide for themselves. Even after the fall of the Fifth Nation, piracy is a tempting alternative to poverty. The Southern Water Tribe has no navy to protect itself with, and as a result is particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part15.htm#bookmark26" class="s22">In contrast, Agna Qel’a (page 20)</a> and the Northern Water Tribe’s economic success is evident in the design of their Royal Palace, their military, and the general well-being of their popula- tion. During this time, Agna Qel’a is open to visitors who general- ly must arrive via ship or sky bison. Avatar Kuruk was born in the Northern Water Tribe, but because of his perceived failings as the Avatar, mentioning him in polite company is frowned upon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many in the South question how those in the North could claim to govern them and fail to support their struggling peoples. With the tribal chieftains at a political stalemate, lesser chieftains in the South now organize themselves to parlay with the North and open up new roads of communication. While these chieftains may have lost hope in the South, they’ll ensure their people’s survival.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Atuat</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most skilled healer in the world</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Atuat is an incredibly powerful healer from the Northern Water Tribe, and if she can’t heal someone it means there is no help for them at all. Atuat is cocky and a bit impetuous, but only because she is very confident in herself and her legitimately impressive skills. When not attending to people as a healer, Atuat enjoys getting up to a little mischief and fun. The fastest way to her heart is to invite Atuat on an adventure. Even while assisting the Avatar, she still found time to gamble, eat good food, and show off a little.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those studying healing through waterbending could learn a lot from her, but Atuat is fairly traditional in her beliefs. Since only women are allowed to learn healing in the Northern Water Tribe, Atuat is likely to only offer instruction to other women. Should a hero or their ally become badly wounded, Atuat might be their only hope of recovery.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tagaka</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A former pirate queen being held in the prison beneath Lake Laogai <span class="p">Tagaka is a cunning Waterbender who led the Fifth Nation, and whose father and grandfather led the Fifth Nation before her. She is a ruthless opponent and cleverly hid her true strength as a bender for many years. When Tagaka was captured and sent to</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">prison following the destruction of her fleet, the remnants of the pirate group were left without a leader.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now, all that remains of the Fifth Nation is a handful of splinter fleets, but they may very well regroup and find a new leader if they can’t rescue Tagaka from the prison beneath Lake Laogai. Heroes might be sent to rescue her, but not necessarily out of concern for the pirate queen…Tagaka enslaved many people during her time leading the Fifth Nation, and she may be the only person who remembers where she ultimately sent those people.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Kuruk</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The previous Avatar on a quest to find his fiancée</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Kuruk died when he was only thirty-three years old, and his time as the Avatar is considered by most to be a deep disap- pointment as he let many of his responsibilities slip. In truth, Kuruk’s life was marred by tragedy and loneliness, and he turned to unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with the pain caused by hunting dark spirits. Though Kuruk is no longer alive, he has attempted to communicate with and help the current Avatar. On one such occasion, Kyoshi connected with him while she was</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the Spirit World and he revealed some of his most important memories to her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those who find themselves in the Spirit World and in need of help might run across Kuruk, as he is on a mission there to find his deceased fiancée, Ummi, taken by Koh the Face Steal- er. Also, his memory is still felt in the Northern Water Tribe, and friends of his may still be struggling to come to terms with the course of his life.</p>

<a name="bookmark41">Pitseolak</a>
</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An old warrior on a mission to restore his tribe and bring an end to piracy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Pitseolak is an older warrior from the Southern Water Tribe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">determined to hunt down pirates from his tribe and make them return home. He blames the recent history of young people going off to become pirates for the Southern Water Tribe’s decline. Combat is a challenge for the elderly warrior, but he still has some fight in him and what he lacks in physical prowess he makes up for in battle wisdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Unlike the Northern Water Tribe which has robust and organized defenses, the Southern Water Tribe relies on a militia. Many Capital City militia members respect Pitseolak for his dedication and almost supernatural skill with a bladed boomer- ang, despite his often outspoken and wacky nature. Warriors looking to train in weapons could hardly find a better teacher, but Pitseolak will want help with pirates in return.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aupilaarjuk</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A stealthy courier who brings important messages from one tribe to the other</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Aupilaarjuk is an adventurous courier from the Southern Water</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tribe responsible for delivering special correspondences between the two tribes. Her job is risky because sometimes she carries messages that others don’t want to arrive at their destination, and there’s a great distance between the two tribes where things can go wrong. Her current job is of the utmost importance as she ferries messages between the lesser politicians of the two tribes working to support the south and defend against pirates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">She can offer introductions to important people in either tribe, as well as to the White Lotus with whom she’s had a few clandes- tine interactions. Aupilaarjuk only speaks of her relationship with the White Lotus to a trusted few since she occasionally works as a courier for them as well. When the White Lotus hires her to make a delivery, it’s because that delivery is of extreme importance and would result in disaster if it fell into the wrong hands.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chukagnak</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A healer-turned-pirate who wants to climb to the top</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chukagnak is a young Northern Water Tribe healer who has em- braced a life of piracy. She was a poor healer and hated the man she was arranged to marry, so she left home before the trappings of tradition could swallow her. Now she lives life by her own rules and respects others who do the same as long as they don’t get in her way. Chukagnak loves the little luxuries in life, whether they come in the form of silky pillows, extravagant feasts, or exotic birds. She doesn’t care what others think of her, but does tire of disrespect quickly and has no qualms with throwing repeat offenders overboard.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Chukagnak is a bit of an oddity within the pirate world since not many from the Northern Water Tribe turn to this kind of life. She is now in command of a Fifth Nation splinter fleet at odds with some of the other splinter fleets. Recently, she sank several ships filled with valuable cargo but had to escape before they could retrieve it. Heroes who need items in that cargo must consult with Chukagnak to locate it, but she always asks for a favor or boon in return.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Economic Troubles in the Southern Water Tribe</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark53" class="s22">The Southern Water Tribe is far from thriving. While the worst is yet to come in the Hundred Year War (page 56),</a> members of the tribe feel the strain of the failing economy. Some locals</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">must leave home to find more lucrative work, while others may take on riskier jobs nearby, such as hunting dangerous creatures, in order to make ends meet. If heroes need something from members of the Southern Water Tribe, they may need to lend help first before anyone can afford to take the time to assist.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom Sage Jianzhu recently tried to persuade Lu Beifong to lend the Southern Water Tribe money in order for them to better thrive, but his attempt failed due to the political maneuvering of Beifong’s chamberlain, Hui, before all three of them died. Though Hui claimed to oppose the proposed loan because the tribe could become a threat to the Earth Kingdom if it grew too much…in reality, he wanted to thwart the initiative simply because it was Jianzhu who proposed it.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Harmony Without, Turmoil Within</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the Spirit Oasis is beautiful and serene, it has unfortunate- ly been struck by tragedy in the past. Koh the Face Stealer, a fright- ening spirit who lives up to his name, emerged from the Oasis to abduct Avatar Kuruk’s fiancée, Ummi. He then, of course, stole her face as well. Though these types of incidents are rare, it does seem that there may be a passage to the Spirit World at the bottom of the pond. Those who visit the Spirit Oasis may be at risk should another spirit with malicious intentions rise out of the waters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part15.htm#bookmark27" class="s22">If a spirit were to arise, the Water Tribes’ people are perhaps the best equipped to deal with it, as they’ve lived near the Spirit Oasis and both Spirit Portals (page 21)</a> for their entire exis- tence. However, the world is changing and as the Air Nomads struggle to maintain other spiritual sites in the world, the Water Tribes may face unexpected opposition from the spiritual sites they’ve lived in harmony with for so many years.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Piracy</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Law and Order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fifth Nation is now a handful of dangerous splinter fleets and there are still unaffiliated pirates on the sea. Many of them come from the Southern Water Tribe, turning to piracy in order to avoid poverty. Now that there is a hole left behind by the Fifth Nation, perhaps another pirate fleet can rise to power and fill it. Members of the Southern Water Tribe may need to leave their families and homes behind to pursue such a life, but they may also be better able to support those families with the money they earn as pirates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Anyone traveling by sea risks encountering these pirates. Someone chasing a ship to a coastal village might encounter hostile villagers willing to hide the pirates, because they provide food for their community. Anyone on land looking to hold these sailors accountable for their actions must wade into the murky waters of deciding who is truly guilty—those who steal to sur- vive or those who have so much and refuse to share.</p>
