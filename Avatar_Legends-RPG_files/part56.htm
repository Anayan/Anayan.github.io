<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hold, +1 Forward, &amp; +1 Ongoing</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Some moves refer to hold, taking +1 forward, and taking +1 ongoing as outcomes—these are bonus- es! <b>Hold </b>is a temporary resource connected to the move you got it from—when you receive it, you “hold” onto it until you spend it as outlined by that move. If a move tells you to “hold 3,” for example, you gain three points to spend on that move’s options and effects. Moves with hold often tell you how to spend it, like “one-for-one,” meaning you can spend one point of hold on one of the move’s possible effects. Since you’re “holding” onto it, you don’t need to spend all of your hold at once! You might spend hold right away on an effect or save it for later in a scene.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Hold usually has to be spent in the course of the conversation or scene in which you gain it, unless the move specifies how and when the hold expires. If you’re unsure if your hold is still available, ask the GM for clarification. If you have hold from multiple sources, they don’t pool together and you can’t spend it between two moves’ options. To keep track of any hold, you might use a die, tokens, or coins, or just make hatch marks on your playbook—but most of the time, you spend it fast enough that you don’t have to keep close track.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a move tells you to <b>take +1 forward</b>, you gain</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">+1 on your next roll that applies. These effects often state “take +1 forward to/when <u>&nbsp; </u>,” meaning the bonus is added to the action or condition listed.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Once you’ve used the bonus, it’s gone. Since a +1 forward applies to the <i>next </i>roll you make that fits the conditions, you can’t hang onto it for later— it’s not hold! When a move tells you to <b>take +1</b>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<b>ongoing </b>instead, that bonus applies to <i>all </i>applicable rolls as described by the move. Moves that give +1 ongoing tell you how long the bonus lasts for, but if need be, the GM is the final arbiter of when the bo- nus ceases to apply—usually when much time has passed or the situation has substantially changed.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intimidate</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they give in with a few stipulations,” </i>they do what you want (back off or give in) but they’ve demands of their own. If you go back on these, things are likely to get messy. They might only back off if you promise to back off as well or want something from you in exchange.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you <b>intimidate an NPC </b>into backing off or giving in, roll with <span class="s49">Passion</span>. On a hit, they choose one. On a 10+, first, you pick one they cannot choose.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• They run to escape or get backup.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• They back down but keep watch.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• They give in with a few stipulations.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• They attack you, but off-balance; the GM marks a condition on them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they attack you, but off-balance,” </i>they lash out (and likely trigger a combat exchange) but they’re struck by your words in some way—the GM also marks an appropriate condition on them. This reflects you getting under their skin, which gives you a slight advantage as the interaction comes to blows.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Demanding surrender from a <i>daofei </i>society leader at spearpoint after taking out their minions, using your family’s dangerous reputation to pressure a smuggler into giving you a stolen item, threatening a bouncer to let you into an exclusive gambling house—any time you threaten an NPC into retreat or surrender with words or fists, you are <span class="s8">intimidating </span>them. You might <span class="s8">intim- idate an NPC </span>with physical threats and harsh words but you can just as easily intimidate them with displays of power, blackmail, or other more subtle tactics. As long as you’re trying to scare them off or pressuring them to give up/in, you make the move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you roll a hit to <span class="s8">intimidate</span>, your target (not you) chooses one of the four options based on their goals and the fiction. If you roll a 10+, you limit the NPC’s actions by removing one option before they choose, pushing them further in the direc- tion you want. If you want to force an NPC to surrender without fleeing, remove their option to <i>“run to escape or get backup.” </i>If you don’t care if they flee but you don’t want to come to blows (again), say they can’t <i>“attack you off-balance.”</i>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that you can only target NPCs with this move—if you want to push your companions to do (or not do) something, you need to try a different tactic (like <span class="s8">calling them out</span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark116" class="s22">, see page </a>138). Although you might argue with each other about the right thing to do at the moment, PCs in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends:</span>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Intimidating</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a hit to <span class="s8">intimidate an NPC</span>, remember that the GM chooses how your target responds. This depends on their goals, feelings (and marked conditions), and the fiction of the game, but they might just give you what you want even if you don’t roll a 10+.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they run to escape or get backup,” </i>they immediately try to flee the scene. If you want to stop the NPC, you need to try something fast or even drop into a combat exchange to keep them here. Once they leave, they either stay gone if they’re try- ing to escape or alert others and escalate the situation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they back down but keep watch,” </i>they give in to you for now but they’re still on their guard. They won’t make a move against you just yet but if you give them a reason or push them further, the situation gets worse. Hostile NPCs give you leeway but with hands on their weapons, while others keep a stern eye on any potential troublemaking.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quartz the Guardian wants to get into the Spirit Shrine, but it’s guarded by Fire Nation soldiers. Quinn, Quartz’s player, describes Quartz stomping up to the guards. “I’m getting close and telling them I’m an undercover Fire Nation operative—I’m doing my best to look all impressive and cow them into letting me through. Is that an <b>intimidate</b>?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“No, I don’t think so,” says the GM. “It’s more of a <b>trick</b>—it depends upon them believing you’re an undercover Fire Nation operative, right?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Ah, I get it,” says Quinn. “Okay, well, I still want to say that, but it’s pure pretense—I don’t care if they buy it or not. I just stand there, glaring at them, flexing my muscles, picking at scars.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The GM considers—in another situation, it might not be quite enough to be intimidating just to stare and flex, but here, these are only regular guards. “Perfect, that’s an <b>intimidate</b>. Roll!”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quinn rolls and gets a 12! “I kind of want to say that they can’t run and get backup…but I think I’m more worried about them attacking me and slowing me down, so I pick that. They can’t attack me.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Great!” says the GM. “They look at each other, and it’s clear they both don’t want a fight. ‘Ah, yes, uh, sir,’ says one. ‘Feel free to make your way inside.’ As soon as you do, you look behind and you see they’ve run off, presumably to go get help. What do you do?”</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Teru Jinno the Successor has just been apprehended by Republic City’s police force. He’s wrapped up in metal wire as they’re carting him off. “One officer sneers at you,” says the GM. “‘Any- thing to say for yourself?’ she asks.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“I look back up at her and sneer right back,” says Tyrelle, Teru’s player. “‘Yeah,’ I say. ‘Wait until my mother hears about this.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Aiko Jinno isn’t known to be kind to those who interfere with her plans…or her family.’”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Is that an <b>intimidate</b>? Invoking the name of your great and terrible mother?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Oh for sure,” says Tyrelle, and he rolls. He gets a 7.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM considers what the guards will do—the GM could pick any option off the list, but in this case they think it’d be better if the guards just give in. “Well, immediately as soon as they hear your mother’s name, the officers all share a glance, and then they begin to rapidly unwind you from the metal wire. ‘Apologies, sir,’ says one through gritted teeth. ‘We had no idea who you were. Please give the Lady Jinno our best wishes.’ They clearly are angry with you, Teru, but there’s no way they want to cross Aiko Jinno.”</p>

On a 7–9, they need something more—evidence that this is the right course, guidance in making the right choices, or resources to aid them—before they act; the GM tells you what they need. On a 10+, they act now and do their best until the situation changes.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Begging a friendly innkeeper to hide you from the Fire Nation soldiers pursuing you, asking a grateful prisoner you’ve just freed to stay and help instead of escaping, asking a mentor to teach you a bending technique they don’t think you’re ready to learn—any time you try to get help or a favor from an NPC, you are <span class="s8">pleading with an NPC</span>. This move is for more than just calling in a favor or asking for them to back you up. If you ask an NPC for something small (especially something that doesn’t cost them anything), or request help that they’re already willing to give, you don’t trigger this move. If they’re reluctant to assist, the request could cost them or put them in danger, or other things at play might cause them to resist, then you need to <span class="s8">plead </span>with them to get their help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The other important thing about triggering this move is that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the NPC needs to care what you think. If you try to convince an utterly hostile NPC, an NPC who doesn’t take you serious- ly, or an NPC whose life and wellbeing isn’t affected by you in any significant way, you can’t <span class="s8">plead </span>with them. To get an NPC to care about what you think, you need to have an established relationship or do something to make a good impression—you might be their mentor or family member or demonstrate your competence through action or by helping them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In general, this move covers persuasion that isn’t rooted in wisdom or philosophy, and instead focuses on immediate action. If you’re trying to guide someone to (or away from) balance, then you’re <span class="s8">guiding and comforting </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark113" class="s22">them (page 128);</a> if you’re trying to get them to act in a specific way right now, you’re <span class="s8">plead- ing </span>with them.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a hit to <span class="s8">plead </span>with an NPC, they’ll do or give you what you ask for, but they may need a little push before spring- ing into action. On a 7–9, they need reassurance or something extra before helping. An NPC might agree to help you travel through a dangerous area but only if you bring them some supplies they lack for the journey. Another NPC might agree to teach you a dangerous combat technique on the condition you can prove you’ll use it responsibly first. Either way, they won’t commit to helping you until you give them what they need first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a 10+, however, they don’t need any reassurances—they do what you ask right away to the best of their abilities. Re- member, if the situation changes, their response might change as well! If things become dangerous or don’t work out, they may revoke that support. If you <span class="s8">plead </span>with a village elder to change an old tradition and you get a 10+, you might convince them to try it for now but they’ll go back on the agreement if it goes badly for any reason.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Well, I’m not sure they care what you think,” says the GM. “But I’m the last of the Chitin Warriors!” says Bei. “I climb</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">on top of the back of my stag-beetle when I say all this. They should care because I’m a legendary warrior! I’m the Icon!”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Fair enough,” says the GM. The GM also thinks it’s fine here to treat the whole group as a single NPC—at this moment, the whole group functionally has the same drive and principle.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Bei rolls to <b>plead </b>and gets a 7. “The townsfolk look at you, standing on the stag, then at each other, then back at you. Then one of them says, ‘Maybe we have a chance with the Chitin War- rior leading us.’ A bunch of others echo that sentiment, and soon the whole crowd is revving itself up.

I did do him that favor before, when the New Equalists attacked.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM nods in agreement—Iris did help Dai, and he does care what she thinks—and Izzy rolls.

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Swimming through rapids after a pirate ship, convincing some- one you weren’t stealing from them after being caught red-hand- ed, leaping to catch a priceless artifact before it shatters on the floor while your hands and feet are bound—any time you rely on fate and luck to carry you through instead of skills or train- ing, you’re <span class="s8">pushing your luck</span>. If you’re attempting something complicated or risky outside the scope of your training (bend- ing, weapons, or technology), or one of your backgrounds, you trigger this move. A character who’s never sailed before has to <span class="s8">push their luck </span>to steer a boat through a heavy storm, while a PC who served on a pirate ship’s crew could <span class="s8">rely on their skills and training </span>
<a href="part56.htm#bookmark114" class="s22">(page 133)</a> to do the same thing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">This acts as a catch-all move for doing anything risky that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">doesn’t neatly translate to any of the other basic moves. If the outcome of your dangerous action is uncertain or you’re relying on fortune itself to carry you through a risky action, you need</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to <span class="s8">push your luck</span>. The stakes don’t have to be incredibly high for you to make this move—there just has to be interesting uncer- tainty about outcomes!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In some cases, you might try to do something simply beyond both your skills and training, or you might be hoping for a lucky break. The GM may either say you outright can’t do that given the circumstances or just tell you what happens when you try.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Pushing Your Luck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a hit to <span class="s8">push your luck</span>, you always pay a cost for your audacity. The exact cost of succeeding by the skin of your teeth is the GM’s call, and it depends on the situation. The most common cost is marking one or more fatigue or a condition (mostly for physical actions), but costs can include anything: using up supplies, shifting your balance, or more abstract costs. You might claw your way out of a quick-flowing river but ruin your rations or lose a personal item in the water. You might survive a tense social situation with your lies intact, but lose the trust of an involved NPC or expose others to danger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite the cost, <span class="s8">pushing your luck </span>can pay off in the form of an unforeseen opportunity when you roll a 10+. This oppor- tunity is either caused by your boldness or you noticing some- thing in the process of <span class="s8">pushing your luck</span>. As such, it’s usually a time-sensitive opening that must be capitalized on quickly (by you or your companions). The GM describes the opportunity. Remember that getting the opportunity never means that you avoid paying the cost inherent in the move—you <i>always </i>pay a cost when you <span class="s8">push your luck</span>!</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Kirilaq the Rogue is in a bit of a sticky situation and wants to escape. She’s currently locked in a tower overlooking the sea below, awaiting the return of the local tyrannical Earth King- dom governor, who will not look fondly upon her. “Okay…but I have a window, right?” asks Kayla, Kirilaq’s player. The GM nods.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Then…I dive out the window to the sea below! They didn’t know I was a Waterbender when they locked me in here, did they? Yeah, it’ll be perfect! I’ll just waterbend the sea to catch me! So that’s <b>rely on my skills and training</b>, right?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Hold on,” says the GM. “You are very, very, <i>very </i>high. Sure, you can try this—your waterbending abilities give you the slimmest of chances. But it’s definitely <b>pushing your luck</b>, not <b>relying on your skills and training</b>.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Kayla decides to do it anyway, and rolls. She gets an 11! “Okay, so the cost you pay is that this still hurts a bunch, like getting punched in your whole body at once as you hit the water. Mark 3-fatigue. But the opportunity—as you fall, you see a boat out there. You’re certain it’s not flying Earth Kingdom colors, but you’re not certain of much else. If you want, you can use your momentum to bend yourself in an arc through the water and fly up onto the deck of the ship. That’ll only cost 1-fatigue more.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">So, what do you do?”</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ren Tsuji the Prodigy has wound up in the cockpit of a hum- mingbird mecha suit, trying to flee from a squadron of biplanes flown by Triad members! “I gun it!” shouts Ruhan, Ren’s player.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Hold up,” says the GM. “No way you know how to fly this thing. You’re a master martial artist, the greatest archer in the world and deadly with any weapon invented…but you’re not at all trained in Technology, are you?” Ruhan shakes their head. “That’s what I thought. This is <b>pushing your luck</b>, my friend.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ruhan rolls and gets a 9. “Excellent,” says the GM. “So you blast through the air, doing your best to make this thing fly and dodge at the same time—and it works! But not before the mech takes a few hits from the biplanes’ new lightning guns. You</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">pull away from the other biplanes, which turn back to the city as you hurtle into the mountains…where you are DEFINITELY going to crash.”</p>

<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you <b>rely on your skills and training </b>to overcome an ob- stacle, gain new insight, or perform a familiar custom, roll with <span class="s49">Focus</span>. On a hit, you do it. On a 7–9, you do it imperfectly— the GM tells you how your approach might lead to unexpected consequences; accept those consequences or mark 1-fatigue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using wilderness survival skills to pacify an angry armadillo-bear, invoking courtly etiquette to blend into a Fire Nation noble’s party, creating handholds in a stone wall to infiltrate a compound—any time you use your expertise and knowledge to overcome a signifi- cant complication or risk, you’re <span class="s8">relying on your skills and training</span>. When you try to do something risky that isn’t covered by any of the other moves and involves your training, one of your backgrounds, or other skills, you use this move. Like <span class="s8">pushing your luck</span>, this catch- all move covers a lot of things but requires more specificity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To know whether or not you can <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training</span>, you need to know <i>what </i>your skills and training are. At the start of the game, the clearest indicators of these are your training (bending, weapons, technology) and your backgrounds. If your character used to work at City Hall in Republic City (using the Urban and Privileged backgrounds), it stands to reason that you can <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>to play politics and navigate bureaucracy, know your way around the city, and fit into high society. If you’re an Airbender, you might <span class="s8">rely on your airbending </span>to cushion your fall</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">off a rooftop, deflect incoming projectiles with a burst of wind, or even—with enough training—sense danger by air vibrations alone. Your playbook can also point to things that you can <span class="s8">rely </span>on, like the Icon’s <span class="s20">Burden &amp; Tradition </span>or the Successor’s <span class="s20">A Tainted Past</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s important is to make note of what these skills and training are as they come up, and to keep in mind what’s outside your areas of expertise. As you play, you’ll gain more skills and learn about what things your character can do with their train- ing. Your character might eventually gain mastery over a wide array of skills and talents but at the start of the game, there’s only so much you can <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>to do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The actual effects of this move cover a lot of ground, as well. First, you can try to overcome obstacles. Most commonly this means physical obstacles, like barriers or hazards, but it can mean social obstacles as well. Your firebending can help you blast the door into ashes, but your upbringing as a servant in the high court of the Fire Nation can help you get into the servants’ quarters of the local manor without any suspicion. You can even “overcome an obstacle” to quickly dispatch low-threat foes, if appropriate—clocking two clueless guards on the back of the head might knock them out with a single <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>move, bypassing combat altogether. “Overcome obsta- cles” is a fairly open-ended idea that almost always means, “solve a problem with your training or skills.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">You can also try to gain new insights. When you <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>to do so, you’re using your expertise or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">specific abilities to look for more specific information than what you might find just by examining a scene or even <span class="s8">assessing a situation</span>. You might use your training to improve or extend your senses—like earthbending to locate a hidden attacker through seismic sense—or give you specialized insights that others with- out your skills might miss, like a Technologist figuring out how to shut down an experimental device gone haywire.</p>
