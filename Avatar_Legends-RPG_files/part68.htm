<p class="s75" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“I don’t want to mark a condition,” says Nadja. “I say, ‘Okay, yeah. We’ve got to be careful—that’s the smart play.’ Then I look apologetically at Teru Jinno.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Don’t forget, you get to shift Ren’s balance</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">roes’ planning to uncover more information about the underground spirit-vine-weapon trade by attending Uncle Guzai’s Temple of Fortune—a seedy gambling den known to be a hub for local triad members. The PCs are in Iris’s apartment in the city—a small place, but cozy, with haphazard couches for everybody to crash on—and they’re arguing about exactly what to do. Iris and Teru Jinno think they should just smash down the door, but Ren and Shihan think watching the enemy is very important, and Nokahhak actually agrees with Ren but wants to impress Teru…</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I look very indecisive,” says Nokahhak’s player, Nadja. “My eyes are flicking back and forth between Ren and Teru.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“‘Nok, come on,’ I say,” says Ren’s player, Ruhan. “‘Throwing yourself into a pit of Triad members to try to shake answers loose from them…that’s not brave. That’s just dumb. You’re smarter than that.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be the Airbender Tenzin would be proud to call his student.’ Can I <span class="s78">guide and comfort </span>Nokahhak?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I can kinda see it,” says the GM. “But it’s way closer to openly <span class="s78">calling on someone </span>to live up to their principle. You’re playing on Nokahhak’s Confi- dence, right?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yes! That’s even better!” Ruhan shifts Ren Tsu- ji’s balance one step away from center—now Ren is at Excellence +2—and then Ruhan rolls 2d6, add- ing in Nokahhak’s Confidence principle, currently at</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">+1. Ruhan gets a 6—not quite enough!</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Can I <span class="s78">help</span>?” asks Seiji. “I really want Nokahhak to buy into what Ren Tsuji is saying. ”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 114pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah,” says the GM. “What do you do?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I step forward and put my hand on Ren’s shoul- der, looking at Nokahhak seriously. ‘Yeah, you’re better than that. You’re a Water Tribe warrior and an Air Nation Airbender!’ I really want to sell how awesome Nokahhak is,” says Seiji.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great! Mark fatigue!” Seiji marks one of Shi- han’s fatigue, and Ruhan’s roll is now a 7—a hit! Nokahhak must act as Ren Tsuji says or mark a condition, and Ren must mark 1-fatigue or let No- kahhak shift Ren’s balance once in either direction. Ren’s plea works on Nokahhak, but it leaves Ren open to Nokahhak’s words.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 114pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Okay, Nok? What do you do?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">unless Ren marks 1-fatigue,” says the GM. “Right, yeah. I want to shift Ren back toward</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Community—definitely down from Excellence! ‘Good call, Ren,’ I say to them. I want them to feel like I listened, like they’re a part of something, not just the outsider who’s smarter than everybody!” says Nadja.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ruhan decides not to mark 1-fatigue and shifts Ren’s balance back to Excellence +1.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“‘I still think we should just blow down the door!’” says Tyrelle as Teru Jinno. “‘I’m not ready to go along with this plan!’”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs could try to persuade Teru Jinno much as Ren persuaded Nokahhak—by <span class="s78">calling out </span>Teru’s Care principle, for example—but the GM thinks the game needs to move on to some new conflicts and decides to introduce something new to the scene.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“There’s a knock on the door. Iris, you recognize the voice on the other side when it says, ‘Hey!</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Open up! We know you’re in there!’ It’s Kehan, your former Earth Empire comrade in your squad. Have you talked at all since you’ve come to Repub- lic City?” the GM says. They’re turning attention on Iris, who hasn’t really gotten to participate in the argument for a bit, to share the spotlight and get everyone involved.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, no, I think I was trying to steer clear of my old life,” says Izzy. “I haven’t talked to Kehan in ages.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great. Well, that’s definitely his voice on the other side of the door. What do you do?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I’m not sure,” says Izzy. “I think I’m frozen after recognizing Kehan’s voice.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Yeah, that’s fine,” says the GM. “Teru? What do you do?” Again, the GM tries to share the spotlight with someone who was less engaged earlier.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“I react immediately,” says Tyrelle. “I leap up, tear open the door, and say, ‘What?’ to whoever is on the other side.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Awesome! So, Iris, why don’t you tell us what you remember Kehan looking like?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, I remember that he looked young, full of ener- gy and patriotic fire. He was clean shaven,” says Tyrelle.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Was he powerfully built? Lanky?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I think he didn’t seem big enough to fill out his uniform,” says Izzy.</p>

<p class="s75" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah, great. Iris, he doesn’t look the same at all. Now he’s got a chinstrap beard, and a few burn scars along his cheek. His head is now half-shaved,</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">half not, and the hair he does have is long and hangs over the side of his face. He looks tougher, maybe not super-muscly, exactly, but definitely like the smaller guy you remember was hardened in the time since last you’ve seen him. He’s wearing a green suit with silver accents, and it’s a pretty nice suit. He’s also got two other people behind him, one of them wearing a brownish red suit with a truncheon in her hand and a scar running over her lips, and the other with a blue jacket and a long braided beard.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Teru, the guy in front—Kehan—looks a smidge startled as you tear open the door and face him,</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but you’re not a big person, and in no time Kehan is scowling at you and looking at you like you’re nothing. ‘That’s not a good way to greet guests,’ he says. ‘You gonna invite us in?’”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Wait a sec,” says Seiji. “These guys sound like triad members. Would I recognize them from my work with the Street Soldiers?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Yes,” says the GM. “You’ve seen them all before, though you’ve probably never tangled with them or arrested them outright. They’re Triple Threats.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Okay, cool,” says Seiji. “I get up then, and I hiss to Teru, ‘Play this cool.’ I don’t want to get into a fight with the Triads in Iris’s apartment.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Pfft,” says Tyrelle. “I can take them. ‘No, you don’t get invited in. Say what you came here for and then leave us alone.’ Can I <span class="s78">intimidate </span>them?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Sure—you want them to back off so they just stay out here in the hall and then leave, instead of coming in?” Tyrelle nods in response. “What do you actually do to frighten them?” the GM asks.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I pull out one of my little two-pronged taser devices and flick the button so electricity crackles across it,” Tyrelle says. Teru Jinno’s fighting style uses a hummingbird mech, but he often has all man- ner of devices on his person, so it makes sense that Teru Jinno has the device on hand.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Excellent,” says the GM. “Roll with <span class="s59">Passion</span>!” Tyrelle rolls and gets a 12!</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I pick that they can’t attack us; like I said, I don’t want to get in a fight right here.” The GM looks</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at the other options for the Triad members, and chooses that they back down but keep watch— they’re fine staying in the hall and keeping things to a discussion, but they’re still ready if things escalate.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Kehan&#39;s eyes flick to your device, and he says ‘Fine. Be that way. We heard you all were asking questions, and we decided to be polite, introduce ourselves, and offer our help as friendly neighborhood representa- tives. Uncle Guzai’s Temple of Fortune is a pillar of</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: center;">the community, and you should only go there in good faith, to lose your money and spend time in good com- pany. There certainly aren’t any illegal weapons there.’” “‘And what, I’m supposed to just believe that?’”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: center;">says Tyrelle, speaking as Teru.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“‘Most certainly. Both because it’s true, and be- cause it’s good for your health.’ Kehan then makes a motion to the other two, and they start to shift away. ‘Be seeing you,’” says the GM.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Wait!” says Izzy. “Before they go, I want to pop my head around Teru. ‘Kehan, wait,’ I say.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Kehan freezes at the sound of your voice, Izzy, and slowly turns to look at you. ‘Iris?’ he says.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“‘Kehan, we’re trying to get rid of the spirit vine weapons. You know they’re too dangerous. You know they shouldn’t be in the hands of…people who might use them. Please…help us. Help me. Tell us where the weapons are<span class="s79">…</span>”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, that definitely sounds like you’re <span class="s78">pleading</span>
</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">with him,” says the GM. “Roll with <span class="s59">Harmony</span>!” “Oh, crud, I’m at -1 <span class="s59">Harmony</span>,” says Izzy. “Wait,</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">can I <span class="s78">live up to my principle</span>? I’m being restrained, I’m trying to talk to someone instead of barging ahead! My Restraint is +0, a little better than -1 <span class="s59">Harmony</span>.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah, that makes sense. Roll it!”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Izzy marks a fatigue to <span class="s78">live up </span>to her Restraint and rolls…and gets a 3!</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oof,” says the GM. “Your friends could help you get to a 7 if all four of them each marked 1-fatigue, but your appeal here is so personal, I don’t think they can help in the fiction.” The GM considers what move to make and decides to keep it fairly sim- ple—<i>inflict a condition </i>
<a href="part96.htm#bookmark187" class="s76">will do the trick (page 230).</a>
</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“There’s this moment where you think Kehan’s face is clearing, like he might actually listen…but then he hardens: ‘I don’t owe you anything,’ he says. ‘You always said the Earth Empire was right, that it was the only way to fix the world. You said it took courage to do what was necessary. And then one day, you just abandoned us. And now, you’re here trying to tell me that the weapons are too dangerous? I’m not going to tell you anything, and you can’t make me. You don’t</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">have it in you anymore.’ Mark a condition, Iris—I think Insecure, right? He’s making you doubt yourself., right?</p>

<p class="s75" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I think it might be Guilty, but I’ve already got that marked. So yeah, Insecure fits,” says Izzy, and she marks Insecure on her sheet. “And it kind of sounds like he’s shifting my balance, calling back how much I was about doing what was necessary.”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, sure!” says the GM. They hadn’t planned on Kehan shifting Iris’s balance, but it makes sense. “He’s shifting your balance away from Restraint. Do you accept it?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“No, I don’t want to let this moment define me. I want to <span class="s78">resist </span>it, but I’ve got Insecure marked now, so I’m rolling at a -2, right?” The GM nods, and Izzy rolls. She gets a total of a 7!</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great! So I don’t shift my balance at all! And I actually want to clear a condition by proving him wrong immediately—can I clear Insecure even though I just marked it?” asks Izzy.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I think that depends on what you do. How do you try to prove him wrong?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I move over to him and I put an arm on him, and I say, ‘I was wrong back then. The Earth Empire was wrong. It wasn’t the only way to fix the world, and it takes way more courage to admit you’re wrong and to try to do better. And for what it’s worth…I’m sorry for what I did to you.’ Is that enough?” asks Izzy.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM considers for a moment—what Iris said was meaningful. There’s an uncertainty to whether or not Iris’s words would reach Kehan, but the GM thinks she is proving him wrong to herself. “Yeah, I think you should clear a condition or mark growth, but I also think you’re <span class="s78">guiding and comforting </span>him—you want to guide him to forgiveness because it’ll help him too, right?” Izzy nods. “So why don’t you roll with <span class="s59">Harmony </span>again.” Izzy clears Guilty, groans because she’s rolling on her -1 again, and rolls. She manages to get an 8 this time!</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But does Kehan embrace Iris’s guidance or shut her down? The GM created Kehan just now, so they haven’t assigned him a drive or a balance principle yet. The GM does both right now—Kehan has a drive to take over the Triple Threat Triad and his principle is</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dominance. The GM thinks Kehan has just skyrocket- ed from a minor NPC to a major NPC, thanks to Iris’s interest in him, so Kehan has a balance track of 0 to</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">+2. The GM sets Kehan’s initial balance to +2 Domi- nance—Kehan was already pretty far down that track by the time he showed up at the apartment today. With that in mind, the GM decides that Kehan wouldn’t embrace Iris’s guidance—not yet.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Again, there’s this moment that reads like Kehan is trying to get there, trying to forgive you…but then he can’t. He pulls his arm away from you and says, ‘Your lame apologies aren’t worth anything.’ And then he and the other two move away down the hall. He shut you down, Iris, so go ahead and mark a condition— Troubled, I think, for what you see happening to him. But you do get to shift his balance, too. You probably don’t quite know yet what his principle is, though you might have some guesses, but you can still tell me if you want to shift his balance up or down—do you want to make him more or less extreme?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">“Down! Definitely down,” says Izzy.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great. So the three of them leave, and you’re left alone again. What do you do?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“As they go,” says Seiji. “I want to slip out of the apartment and track them. I just go, I don’t wait for anyone else. I’ve got an Urban background—can</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I follow them, move through the city to see where they’re going?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Oh, definitely!” says the GM. “I do think it’s risky, though—they might catch you following them. Why don’t you roll to <span class="s78">rely on your skills and training</span>?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Seiji rolls and gets a total of a 7, so the GM has to tell Seiji what unexpected consequences Shihan</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">might face. “You do it,” say the GM. “You follow them through the city. What does that look like, Shihan?”</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, I use my earthbending to move slowly, cautiously, silently through alleys, making the streets themselves ripple and flow like water as I go,” say Seiji.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Very cool! Yeah, you ripple through alleys to keep an eye on them, but you’re leaving the</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">alleyways a mess. You’re going to draw the attention of a local spirit who takes pride in maintaining the streets unless you mark fatigue to control the mess,” says the GM.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Shoot. Well, I don’t have much fatigue to mark, so I guess I accept it,” says Seiji.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Perfect. So you see the Triad guys actually going into a derelict building—one with a spirit vine shooting through it from bottom to top—but just as you’re about to get a closer look, you hear a voice yell at you. ‘Hey! Stop ruining my alley! I just fixed that!’ And then you see this six-legged bunny spirit with a flat tail, frantically trying to flatten out the ground of the alleys that you’ve left askew, and glaring at you. What do you do?”</p>
