<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every character in <span class="s8">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>can use basic moves, each of which move the game’s story forward. There are seven of them: <span class="s8">assess a situation</span>, <span class="s8">guide and comfort</span>, <span class="s8">intimidate</span>, <span class="s8">plead</span>, <span class="s8">push your luck</span>, <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training</span>, and <span class="s8">trick</span>. The move to <span class="s8">help another companion </span>is also explained here. This section covers how each of the moves work in more detail with in-game examples.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assess a Situation</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you <b>assess a situation</b>, roll with <span class="s49">Creativity</span>. On a 7–9, ask one question. On a 10+, ask two. Take +1 ongoing when acting on the answers.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• What here can I use to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Who or what is the biggest threat?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• What should I be on the lookout for?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• What’s my best way out/in/through?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Who or what is in the greatest danger?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Looking for a way to escape the path of a rampaging boar-q-pine, scouting ahead for danger in a mysterious cave, sizing up your oppo- sition in a heated negotiation—any time you try to gather specific or useful information during a tense moment, you make the <span class="s8">assess a situation </span>move. If you’re simply taking in a scene or looking for surface details about a situation, you don’t trigger this move just yet. The GM tells you everything you could want to know at the surface level—even if they tell you, “From a quick glance, you’re not sure, you can’t tell.” Once you start scrutinizing a situation in more detail, look for specific information, or want to find answers to any of the questions listed under this move, then you’re <span class="s8">assessing a situation</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Crucially, the GM always answers the questions fully and hon-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">estly. When you ask, <i>“Who or what is the biggest threat?” </i>their answer <i>is </i>the biggest threat. If someone new shows up or the situation changes, then the answer might change, but at the moment that you ask the question, you can know the answer is complete and true.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whatever answers you get, you take +1 ongoing when acting on that information. This means as long as you take action based on those answers, you add +1 to all moves you make. If the situ- ation changes significantly—like if a new, bigger threat appears or you find your way out of the situation—then this bonus no longer applies. It’s possible to act on multiple answers at once, in which case you stack the +1 ongoing bonus, as long as you don’t exceed the limit of +4 to a roll (including your stats).</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Assessing a Situation</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What here can I use to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>?” <span class="p">is the question to ask if you’re looking for something specific to accomplish a goal, whether it’s an item or environmental feature. If you’re being chased by gangsters through busy city streets, you might ask the GM, “What here can I use to slow them down?” You can fill in the</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">blank with anything you like, but sometimes the answer might be “nothing,” in which case you have to think on your feet or try a different tactic.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Who or what is the biggest threat<span class="p">?” tells you who or what is the most dangerous person or thing in the situation. You can specify if you’re most concerned with threats to yourself or to others. The GM then tells you which of the multiple hostile NPCs is the most dangerous to you and your companions, which of the various hazards in an environment is the most important to avoid, or just who is the nastiest, most intimidating person in the room.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<i>“What should I be on the lookout for?” </i>lets you know what dangers or complications hide here, foreshadowing problems before they arise; you might find signs of something dangerous on the horizon or notice a hazard just before it appears. If you’re <span class="s8">assessing a situ- ation </span>while exploring the Foggy Swamp and ask this question, the GM might say you notice a wild cat-gator lying in wait. If you ask this question in a tense village after dark, you might notice everyone has charms nailed to their homes to ward off dark spirits.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“What’s my best way out/in/through?” <span class="p">helps you figure out a way to get into or out of somewhere. When you ask this ques- tion, decide which of the three options you’re focusing on—out, in, or through. A way out helps you escape the situation, a way in helps get you </span>into <span class="p">danger, and a way through helps you bypass obstacles or impediments.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Who or what is in the greatest danger?” <span class="p">might sound similar to “Who or what is the biggest threat?” but it’s about finding vulner- abilities in your surroundings, not dangers to yourself. When you ask this question, you’re focusing on the people </span>affected <span class="p">by threats, rather than identifying the threats themselves. This can give you insight into impending perils or the plans of an antagonistic NPC.</span>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Haki the Successor has been thrown into a cell by the Earth Kingdom soldiers! Hector, Haki’s player, says, “I’m wandering around the cell, examining everything. I need to find a way out! Can I <b>assess the situation</b>?” The GM agrees, and Hector rolls, getting an 11. <i>“What’s my best way out?” </i>asks Hector.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“You can’t really firebend your way out of here—the cell’s too small, you might just roast yourself,” says the GM. “But you can try to land pinpoint strikes on the cell’s bars—they’re crumbling, and if you apply your chi-blocking techniques just right, you might be able to knock them out. What’s your other question?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Hector thinks for a moment, and then says, “<i>What should I be on the lookout for? </i>What’s going to get in the way of my escape?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, yeah, well there’s guards in this place, but you think you can handle them—the big problem is the water traps you spy in the ceiling. They’re barrels of water that can be dropped with a bit of earthbending, and they’ll douse fires in a moment—clearly, this prison has handled Firebenders before. So, what do you do?”</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Nokahhak the Bold finds herself in the middle of a fancy-dress party—one for which she was deeply unprepared—trying to earn the favor of a local business leader named Wing! “I stand to the side, just kind of taking it all in,” says Nokahhak’s player, Nadja.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Are you <b>assessing the situation</b>?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Well, not originally, but…yeah, that makes sense.” Nadja rolls and gets a 9. “I want to know <i>what can I use here to impress Wing</i>?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Interesting!” says the GM. “You spy Wing out on the dance floor, enjoying herself. The dance is formal, but you can tell Wing has a flair for the dramatic—she keeps dipping and twirling her partner. Maybe you can impress her with a dance?”</p>

<a name="bookmark113">Guide and Comfort</a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">When you try to honestly <b>guide and comfort </b>another person, roll with <span class="s49">Harmony</span>. On a hit, they choose one:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• They embrace your guidance and comfort. They may clear a condition or 2-fatigue, and you may ask one question; they must answer honestly.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• They shut you down. They inflict a condition on you, and you shift their balance in response.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">On a 10+, if they embrace your guidance and comfort, you may also shift their balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Offering life advice to a friend as you brew them a cup of tea, reaching out to someone in pain to show them they’re not alone, teaching a peer self-control through a bending exercise—any time you try to comfort, offer guidance, or steer someone’s course of action through wisdom, not persuasion, you’re <span class="s8">guiding and com- forting </span>someone. This move allows you to help others clear their conditions and fatigue, while also learning about their current feelings…as long as they open up to you. The person you’re trying to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>might not want to hear any advice and push you away instead! That stings, but you still make them think, even if they don’t accept your words or offers of comfort.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">In order to trigger this move, you need to <i>honestly </i>offer com-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fort or guidance to someone else. If you’re deceiving someone by being nice, you’re <span class="s8">tricking </span>them, not <span class="s8">guiding and comforting </span>them. If you’re desperately trying to get them to act in a certain way for your sake, then you’re probably <span class="s8">pleading</span>. If you’re push- ing them to act in accordance with their own values, you’re <span class="s8">call- ing them out </span>with their principle. When you <span class="s10">guide and comfort</span>, you’re being genuine and showing the other person you care about them and how they feel. You might be offering wisdom or advice, but you’re not getting them to do something right this second—you’re just trying to guide them to a better place, to a better balance. Asking someone if they’re all right is a start but you need to offer guidance or comfort to trigger the move (even if you don’t know exactly what’s on their mind when you do).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The most obvious time to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>someone is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">when sharing a quiet moment, like while making camp or after a tense situation, but it’s not the only time you can reach out! You might try to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>an NPC after trading blows in a combat exchange, for example. Maybe you’re confronted by a fellow sword fighting student who blames you for failing to protect your shared master’s life. You can see the anger and guilt in their eyes as you parry their wild swings, so you sheathe your sword and say, “I know you’re in pain; I am too. But killing me won’t bring Master Yeong back. We all tried to save her; now we</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">need to work together to honor her memory.” The GM describes your classmate fighting back tears as they quaveringly point their sword at you; to find out if your words get through to them, the GM says you’re <span class="s8">guiding and comforting</span>!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Guiding and Comforting</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most important part of <span class="s8">guiding and comforting </span>someone is that your target needs to either accept you reaching out or shut you down. If you <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>another PC, they need to do more</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">than just say, “I embrace your guidance and comfort”—they need to show everyone <i>how </i>they do that! This looks different depending on the situation. If you offer a hug and words of reassurance, maybe the other person falls into your arms and sobs out their true feelings. If you show someone how they could improve one of their weakness- es, they might shut you down and blow up in your face about how you’re always telling them they’re not good enough!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they embrace your guidance and comfort,” </i>your target choos- es to immediately clear one of their marked conditions <i>or </i>clear</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2-fatigue. Your offer of comfort helps calm them down or helps them find the strength to press on, depending on the situation. On a 10+, you can also shift their balance however you want. Your words deeply affect them in this moment and get them to consider things in a new light. In both cases, you can ask one question—any one question—and they must answer honestly. The question is generally best phrased in the fiction, something your character asks their character, but it can include awareness that goes slightly beyond the fiction; their “honesty” can take the form of telling glances or body language. You do not have to ask a question if you don’t want to ask one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they shut you down,” </i>your target immediately inflicts a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">condition on you instead—it hurts when you try to help and the other person shuts you out! After they inflict a condition on you, you shift their balance. They might not open up to you but your words still stick with them, reinforcing an already-strong belief, pushing them back from the brink, or helping them find some kind of balance.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Lukta the Idealist doesn’t want to keep fighting against Xue, a Southern Water Tribe rebel and someone Lukta sees a lot of themselves in. “As we’re both panting there after exchanging</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">blows, can I <b>guide and comfort </b>Xue?” asks Lex, Lukta’s player. “Sure!” says the GM. “What exactly do you do?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Hm. I say, ‘We don’t have to do this. We’re more alike than not, and we can work together to bring about real change,’” says Lex.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“That sounds like a guide, sure, but it’s not quite enough—she was just hurling ice spikes at you, after all,” says the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Fair enough,” says Lex. “I put down my tool belt full of traps.” “Oh, nice!” says the GM. “Yeah, that sounds right. Go ahead</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">and roll!” Lex rolls and gets a 10! The GM takes a look at Xue’s drive and balance principle, and decides that Xue embraces Lukta’s guidance.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“There’s a long pause, with a lot of tension…but then she lowers her stance and straightens up. ‘Okay,’ she says. ‘Then how do we do that?’”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM has Xue clear her Angry condition. “Do you have a question you want to ask Xue?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah,” says Lex. “I say it bluntly, ‘As much as possible, we don’t fight. Each other, our foes, anyone. If we can talk to them, guide them to a better path, we do that. Do you think you can do that?’”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“She looks at you blankly, but then she nods, and you can feel the fierceness in her nod. She believes she can,” says the GM. “Do you want to shift her balance? You know her principle is Justice.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, I think so—I’m reshaping her idea of how to get jus- tice, but I’m also supporting it, so I say shift it up,” says Lex.</p>

You pick who you want to be,’” says Shihan’s player, Seiji.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Yeah, that sounds like trying to <b>guide and comfort</b>. Roll for it!” Seiji rolls and gets an 8.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">“Okay, Teru, do you open up to Shihan?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“No,” says Tyrelle. “I’m Angry, so I’m lashing out at a friend to clear it. ‘What do you know about it?! You’re just a pro-bender, and you don’t even know who your parents are!’”</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“I’m still shifting it toward Progress,” says Seiji. “I think my words at least partially got through. And I’m marking Troubled.”</p>
