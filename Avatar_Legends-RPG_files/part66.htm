<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 25pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Defend and Maneuver Approach</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you <span class="s8">defend and maneuver</span>, you’re protecting yourself or others, focusing on the environment and advantages you can build or disadvantages you can inflict. You change your position, maybe try to escape, maybe get to higher ground. You’re not at- tacking directly, but you do your best to block enemy blows. This approach isn’t as aggressive as <span class="s8">advance and attack</span>, but it isn’t as standoffish as <span class="s8">evade and observe</span>. It’s a solid, resistant, tactical approach. The basic techniques for this approach are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ready</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">defend &amp; maneuver</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Mark 1-fatigue to ready yourself or your environment, assigning or clearing a fictionally appropriate status of nearby characters or yourself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Ready, you set yourself or others up, just as you like. Maybe you spread an ice sheet on the ground, setting up the other characters as <i>Impaired</i>. Maybe you create your own ice weapons, set- ting yourself up as <i>Prepared</i>. You can affect a group of foes or a group of allies, as long as what you do makes sense. Think of Ready as tipping the odds in your favor, but without overt, hostile, aggressive action. If you set your foes on fire, you’re not using Ready—you’re probably doing Smash, or Hinder. If you’re creating a line of flame between you and them, however—that’s definitely Ready.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whatever status you inflict with Ready is ultimately deter- mined by the GM, so make sure you are clear about your actions in the fiction when you Ready! Similarly, whether or not you can clear away another status—for example, melting the ice and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">removing <i>Impaired</i>—depends upon your skills and training, too! There isn’t a hard and fast rule for which actions in the fiction lead to specific status effects. Obviously a Firebender can melt the ice with fire, but if an Earthbender moves a large, flat rock into the middle of the ice sheet, then maybe that clears <i>Impaired </i>from any PC who manages to use Seize a Position and move to that rock.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retaliate</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">defend &amp; maneuver</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Steel yourself for their blows. Each time a foe inflicts fatigue, a condi- tion, or shifts your balance in this exchange, inflict 1-fatigue on that foe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Retaliate, you make your opponent struggle, tir- ing them out with return strikes or forcing them to hit harder to breach your defenses. In order to hit you, your opponent has to pay a higher cost—you inflict 1-fatigue on them whenever they inflict fatigue, a condition, or shift your balance! Of course, if your opponent strikes at you but fails to inflict any harm on you for whatever reason, then you don’t inflict any fatigue on them.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If your opponent inflicts 2-fatigue on you, you still only inflict 1-fatigue in return. Similarly, when your opponent inflicts two conditions on you, you only inflict 1-fatigue in return. If they in- flict a condition on you two separate times, however—from two separate techniques, for example—then you inflict 1-fatigue for each, for 2-fatigue total. The key is to think of it in terms of each significant blow they strike on you; you only inflict 1-fatigue in return each time they land a significant blow, representing that additional cost you’re imposing each time they get in a real hit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seize a Position</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">defend &amp; maneuver</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Move to a new location. Engage/disengage with a foe, overcome a negative status or danger, establish an advantageous position, or escape the scene. Any foe engaged with you can mark 1-fatigue to block this technique.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Seize a Position, you move through the battlefield, trying to achieve a particular place of your choice. In every ex- change, the combatants are understood to be moving to greater or lesser extents. Seize a Position, though, is for specific movement toward a particular target or goal—not just the generalized mo- tion of combat. So if you want to go somewhere in particular, or if you want to charge into battle with a new enemy, or if you want to flee from your current opponent…all of that is Seize a Position.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Seize a Position is also a great way to clear negative statuses that depend upon where you currently stand. If you’re <i>Impaired </i>because you’re standing in knee-deep water, you can use Seize a Position to get out of it! More rarely, Seize a Position might</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">grant you a positive status—likely <i>Favored</i>—if you take a partic- ularly beneficial position on the battlefield.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you try to escape the scene, that only happens at the end of the exchange, but as long as you aren’t stopped, you’re gone! Remember, though, that this is for escaping the scene—if you want to lurk at the edges of the fight and be able to reenter it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">later, you’re better off using Seize a Position within or around the fight, instead of trying to escape altogether. If you try to escape but a foe manages to inflict enough fatigue or conditions on you to take you out—for example, with Strike as you flee—then you are taken out <i>and </i>you escape! You wind up helpless and at the mercy of whatever GM move the GM wants to make…but you weren’t blocked from escaping, so you do successfully get away from the fight! The GM shouldn’t move to immediately capture you with the enemies you just escaped from…but you might have unthinkingly escaped into a cave and wake up to find a platypus-bear coming home!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Any foe engaged with you can mark 1-fatigue to stop you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from seizing your new position. This represents your opponents expending their own energy to keep you at bay, stopping you from taking that high ground, keeping you in the water, or pre- venting your escape. All it takes is a single foe marking 1-fatigue to stop you from assuming a superior position or escaping…but remember, trying to make your foes tire themselves out stopping your movement around the field can be a worthwhile strategy!</p>

</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Advance and Attack Approach</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you <span class="s8">advance and attack</span>, you move into direct battle with your foes, sticking to them aggressively, sending countless blows their way. This is a very aggressive approach, not standing back and letting your foe come to you but instead coming at them, hard. You might also expend energy attacking the environment to reshape it to your advantage in some way, but it’s still framed by aggression, advancement, forward-motion—you don’t carefully change the terrain, you break it with force! The basic techniques for this approach are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Strike</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">advance &amp; attack</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Strike a foe in reach, forcing them to mark 2-fatigue, mark a condition, or shift their balance away from center, their choice. Mark 1-fatigue</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">to instead choose to hammer them with your blows, forcing them to mark 2-fatigue, <i>or </i>strike where they are weak, inflicting a condition.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Strike, you focus on landing heavy blows against your opponent. If you choose the <span class="s8">advance and attack </span>approach in general, you’re probably sending attacks your enemy’s way, but if you choose Strike, you’re really committing to landing those hits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Your Strike must be against a foe you’re engaged with, in reach of your skills and training. If you just want to use Strike at no additional cost to you, you can leave it up to your foe how they absorb the hit—they get to choose if they mark 2-fatigue,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mark a condition, or shift their balance away from center. What- ever they choose, they should explain a bit how they took your hit, and how it matches. If they mark 2-fatigue, maybe they put up a tiring block; if they mark a condition, maybe you manage to hit them, and it enrages them (or frightens them, or makes them insecure, etc.). If they shift balance, then maybe they keep the worst of your hits at bay, but at the end of the exchange, they recommit, double-down on their beliefs and desire to fight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you want control over how your opponent absorbs your Strike, however, you can mark 1-fatigue to push yourself harder and either hammer them (inflicting 2-fatigue) or hit where they are weak (inflicting a condition). You can’t force them to shift their balance in this way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pressure</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">advance &amp; attack</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Impress or intimidate a foe. Choose an approach—your foe cannot choose to use that approach in the next exchange.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Pressure against a foe, you keep them at bay, limiting their options for the next exchange. You impress or intimidate your opposition with whatever you do, bringing an emotional compo- nent to your physical actions—describe exactly how you press your foe and how it deprives them of the chance to deploy that approach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you back your foe into a corner, with their back against the wall, maybe you’re preventing them from <span class="s8">evading and observ- ing</span>—no keeping their distance when they’re at point blank against a wall! If you keep them constantly moving, not able to find their footing, maybe you’re preventing them from <span class="s8">advancing and at- tacking</span>—they can’t push back against you! If you lay heavy blows on them, so they can barely keep their guard up, maybe you’re preventing them from <span class="s8">defending and maneuvering</span>—they can’t block fast enough, so they’re forced to either attack or evade!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If multiple allies all use Pressure against the same target, then they can highly limit the foe’s options. But remember, whatever you do has to make sense—it’s not impossible, but very hard to have a situation in which three coordinating allies can remove every possible approach from an enemy. The GM is the final adjudicator on whether or not the use of Pressure makes sense.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smash</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">advance &amp; attack</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Mark 1-fatigue to destroy or destabilize something in the environ- ment—possibly inflicting or overcoming a fictionally appropriate positive or negative status.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When you use Smash, you break, wreck, destroy, or destabilize the environment in some way. Maybe you use a sharp slice of water</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to cut the rope holding a light overhead, use earthbending to rip away a whole wall, or use a careful blast of wind to rip the leaves off a tree. Smash is a great way to directly affect the environment, but it always does so in a destructive fashion—not adding to the environment so much as removing or demolishing it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Smash can easily remove statuses: if an enemy is <i>Favored </i>be- cause they’re surrounded by ancient stones, then smashing those stones removes that status. Similarly, if you suffer from <i>Impaired </i>because smoke is filling the room around you, breaking a wall and letting in fresh air can remove that status. You can even inflict a status on someone by using Smash—knocking a tree over onto an enemy might inflict <i>Trapped </i>unless they get away quickly, for ex- ample. Make sure you describe what you’re targeting and how, so that the GM can adjudicate what statuses are removed or inflicted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Even if you don’t inflict a status, however, keep in mind that Smash still changes the battleground. Destroying the dam and sending water cascading onto the fires in the area still puts out those fires, no matter whether or not anyone suffers a status!</p>

<a name="bookmark126">Evade and Observe Approach</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you <span class="s8">evade and observe</span>, you keep your distance, not running away from your foe but avoiding letting them get close enough to really land any major hits. You dance and dodge, avoiding more than blocking, trying to take in a better sense of your foe and your environment. Instead of intensely focusing on your enemies, you observe the situation and possibly formulate a better strategy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that when you choose <span class="s8">evade and observe </span>as your approach, you immediately clear 1-fatigue. If you don’t have any fatigue marked, you don’t get this benefit. This represents how you fundamentally take a step back, calm yourself a bit, and re- focus every time you choose this approach. The basic techniques for this approach are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Test Balance</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evade &amp; observe</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Mark 1-fatigue to challenge an engaged foe’s balance. Ask what their principle is; they must answer honestly. If you already know their principle, instead shift their balance away from center by questioning or challenging their beliefs or perspective.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Test Balance, you watch your foe, observing how they respond to your movements, seeing how the techniques and actions they use add up…and you’re also talking to them. Test Balance is a great technique for speaking to your foe in the middle of an exchange, be it taunting them, questioning them, bargaining with them—any kind of words designed to reach them and either push them to reveal something about them- selves, or to reshape themselves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you <i>“ask what their principle is,” </i>this is both in-fiction and out-of-fiction. You ask and they must answer at the level of players at the table, but in the actual fight, you might be asking, “What do you care about?! What is driving you to fight like this?!” Even if they try to hide it or stonewall you in the fiction, their player (the GM for all NPCs) must answer honestly, out of character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’ve previously learned their principle in some other way, you may instead shift their balance away from their center. To</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">do that, you must question or challenge their beliefs or perspec- tive—most often, you say things to them that challenge their beliefs, but you can also describe how the actions you take in the middle of the exchange force them to question their own beliefs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s more, if you <i>think </i>you already know their principle, you can name it without having “learned” it first! For example, if you’ve been watching the NPC and you’re pretty sure their principle is something like “Money,” then you can tell the GM</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you’re using Test Balance, and describe how you tell them there’s no profit in this fight, even as you frustrate their every attempt to land a blow against you. As long as you’re in the ballpark, then you can shift their balance; if their principle is “Greed,” you’re close enough, for example!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you aren’t close enough, however, that doesn’t mean you wasted the technique. In their response to your prodding, they reveal their real principle, just as if you had asked in the first place. You always get something when you use Test Balance!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bolster or Hinder</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evade &amp; observe</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aid or impede a nearby character, inflicting an appropriate status.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part64.htm#bookmark124" class="s22">When you use Bolster or Hinder, you use your skills and training to apply a status effect (page 151)</a> to one particular character (or one single group of NPCs). Unlike Ready, this technique doesn&#39;t affect the whole environment—it’s focused on your particular target. In turn, that means Bolster or Hinder can be much more aggressive. Lighting a foe on fire to inflict <i>Doomed </i>on them definitely hinders them! Furthermore, Ready can help you directly—when you use Ready, you might make yourself <i>Prepared</i>. Bolster or Hinder, on the other hand, always targets someone else!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Bolster or Hinder is almost always about creating a new status, not removing an existing status. Most of the time, you&#39;ll apply a positive status to an ally or a negative status to a foe, but, you might rarely find a situation when this technique might remove a status—for example, airbending an ally past the ice below them to remove <i>Impaired</i>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">As with all techniques, make sure you describe what you ac- tually do to use Bolster or Hinder. The status you inflict is always based on the fiction, so it’s crucial for everyone—especially the GM—to understand what you do to determine the right status!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s73" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commit</p>
<p class="s74" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evade &amp; observe</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Recenter yourself amidst the fray. Shift your balance toward one of your principles; the next time you <b>live up to that principle</b>, do not mark fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you use Commit, you do your best to refocus and recenter yourself. You already do a bit of this every time you <span class="s8">evade and observe</span>, but using the Commit technique actively gives yourself a chance to step back from the fray and change your state of mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Commit can appear to be a fairly “fictionless” technique—it’s internal to the character and involves relatively little outward action. But you still describe exactly what you do and that outward action. Does the camera close in on your face as you take in and let out a deep breath? Do you say anything, to yourself or to others? What memories or moments or words flash through your mind? All of this should play into our understanding of why you shift your bal- ance toward your principle, why you are strengthened in your belief.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After using Commit, you do not have to mark fatigue the next time you <span class="s8">live up to the selected principle</span>. This effect lasts until the situation changes drastically; if you haven’t <span class="s8">lived up to the princi- ple </span>usually by the end of the fight, then the effect dissipates. So be sure to shift up a principle you want to use, and then use it!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Because you shift toward “one of your principles,” you can ef- fectively use this technique to shift toward your center, lowering your risk of <span class="s8">losing your balance</span>. Remember, though, that if you do this, there’s a good chance the principle you shifted towards is 0 or lower—so you don’t get much benefit out of <span class="s8">living up to it</span>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Trainings in Combat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whenever you engage someone in combat, you’re using your training. The</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">skills that allow you to toss out strikes, dodge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or block incoming attacks, or easily move across complicated battlegrounds—those all tie to your training. The baseline understanding for any PC in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is that they are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">skilled enough to participate in combats against other skilled opponents, regularly. In game terms, that means you have all the basic techniques completely mastered, and that you can use your training in nearly any way that isn’t a specialized bending form—maybe your Firebender character can’t lightningbend, but they can definitely throw fireballs, ignite fires, inflame or quench existing fires, etc.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That means whenever you choose your stance, use your techniques, and think about combat, you always couch it in terms of your own training. Just like with any other portion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, the fictional world takes precedence. If</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you’re an Earthbender, then your Strike uses your earthbending—maybe you throw a big rock, maybe a per- fectly targeted pebble. If you’re an Airbender, then your Seize a Position uses your airbending—maybe with some kind of air scooter, maybe with just a rushing wind giving you speed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Use your fighting style to add particular shading and spec- ificity to whatever you do in combat, too. If your fighting style involves using fans to channel your airbending, then describe how your Retaliate has you standing at the ready, fans unfolded, prepared to hurl a burst of wind at any foe who gets too close. If your fighting style involves your sash, soaked in water and thus controllable by your waterbending, then describe how your Smash involves the water-drenched sash snapping out from your hand to wrap around the scaffold’s support and rip it away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Your fighting style doesn’t have to be involved in every blow you strike—sometimes, even though your Firebender’s style is “swinging a chain with a flaming censer at each end,” you just want to toss a fireball at someone! That’s okay, but the more you can weave your fighting style into your attacks, blocks, and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dodges, the better. Think of fighting style in this context as a way for you to distinguish your character from all the other fighters who share the same training, and a way to add additional capa- bilities to your moves—if you’re whipping that chain around, maybe you can tangle someone up, and that’s not normally something a Firebender could do!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The nature of your training influences what makes sense, what you can and can’t do, and how it ultimately affects other characters and the environment. The GM is the final arbiter of this, ensuring that the world remains believable while honoring the PCs and their awesomeness. But an Airbender trying to break ice will always have a harder time than an Earthbender hurling a rock at it, or a Firebender melting it away, or a Waterbender turning it back to liquid and pulling it into a bottle. A swordswoman trying to put out a fire is always going to have a harder time than a Firebender simply extinguishing it, or a Waterbender pulling a torrent from the river, or a Technologist carrying some foaming device.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">So when you participate in exchanges, make sure you always say what your character actually does in the fiction! Remember that to do it, you have to do it! That way, your whole group can always get on the same page about what the actual environment looks like, who does what, and why certain statuses come into play. For example, when someone uses Ready, they “assign or clear a fictionally appropriate status from nearby characters (ex: <i>Impaired</i>) or yourself (ex: <i>Prepared</i>).” The only way to know what’s fictionally appropriate is to play to your training, and say what, exactly, you’re doing to use Ready!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That’s just as true for Test Balance—you still have to say what exactly you’re doing or saying to your opponent in order to test their balance and figure out their principle. And the other char- acter’s player (most often the GM) has to do the same, making clear what they say or do in response that reveals their principle or shows how their balance shifts!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Try not to just say, “I <span class="s8">advance and attack</span>, and I choose Strike.” Say, “I take up my fighting stance, before hurling myself at the Earthbender. I <span class="s8">advance and attack</span>. And when I get close enough, I sweep my hands through the air and send a crisscross of fire arcs at his feet—I use Strike!”</p>
