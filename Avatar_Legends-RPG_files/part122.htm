<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This section provides assistance on how to set your game in Ba Sing Se and how to start the adventure. If you have a good idea why your characters would be in the Middle Ring, you can skip directly to “Where we start” and set your PCs on their way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Why are you here?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If this adventure is part of an <span class="s20">ongoing campaign </span>or even <span class="s20">the first adventure after your inciting incident</span>, it can be difficult to place your characters in this adventure if they’re nowhere near the city. If you’re struggling, or if your group’s inciting incident doesn’t start them in Ba Sing Se, give your players a sense of investment in this adventure and tailor your gameplay by asking them these additional questions before you begin:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What information are you trying to find at Ba Sing Se?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Who is a connection you have in the city?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What is your favorite or least favorite circus memory, if any?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If this adventure is a <span class="s20">one-shot</span>, your job as a GM is slightly easier. Ask players to make characters who are from—or who have reason to be in—Ba Sing Se’s Middle Ring. You could even tie their inciting incident to either the Flying Koi Carnival or the Paper Lanterns, giving them motivation for being at the location when the adventure starts. Since you know the contents of the adventure, you can help steer the inciting incident in a direction that connects the players directly with what is going on and then take the game from there.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where we start</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve established why your characters are in the city, introduce the adventure and play! The PCs start in the Flying Koi Carnival, just after Detective Ziming and Lei tell the com- panions about Rose’s disappearance. Before the PCs start their investigation, consider a small warm-up exercise—describe the carnival and its sights, then ask each player a question to frame their character, such as:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What interrupted the companions’ morning routines before the Carnival?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What are the PCs wearing for a fun day at the circus?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• To what circus activity or attraction are the PCs each first drawn?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• How did they get tickets to the Flying Koi Carnival?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Where have they seen the Flying Koi Carnival before?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use whatever answers they give to detail how the players ran into Detective Ziming and Lei. Lei was distraught because her daughter was missing, and the detective was trying to convince Lei to let her handle the investigation alone. Ask the players questions to explain how they got involved, such as:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What about the companions drew Lei’s attention as the heroes she needed?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Why did the PCs agree to help in the investigation?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What made Detective Ziming willing to allow them to assist?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the players are unsure how to answer these questions, feed them information about Lei and Ziming to help. For example, maybe Ziming accepts the companions’ help as long as they’re willing to help the detective prove herself to the police force…or</p>

<a name="bookmark225">maybe Lei is offering a lot of money to find her daughter in spite of Ziming’s assurances. There are numerous reasons the players could want to help, but they should decide on one that best justi- fies their buy-in for their characters to participate in the adventure.</a>

</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve established why the PCs agree to help<span class="p">, it’s up to them to decide how to investigate; although, they’ll find themselves tangled up in this clash of factions no matter what happens through your use of escalations.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are a few ways the PCs can aid in the investigation beyond any plan they may engineer themselves. If they seem stuck on what to do, offer them the following information from an NPC or via gossip they’ve heard on the street. Then use your player-facing moves, GM moves, and escalations to take the adventure from there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Reported thefts have increased in the Middle Ring since the carnival arrived, and Detective Ziming is suspicious, especially since the carnival was where Rose was last spotted. Ziming suggests the PCs go undercover and join the circus. Only as one of the carnival’s own can</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the PCs discover what really goes on backstage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The infamous Paper Lantern Gang runs the territory in the Middle Ring where the Flying Koi set up their carnival. If Rose was kidnapped on their turf, they’re either involved or they have information. Ziming thinks they might be willing to share a lead—or return Rose—in exchange for</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">a favor or enough money to make it worth their time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part125.htm#bookmark229" class="s22">• Lei’s seen Rose hanging out with a “rough-looking” woman; even though her daughter has hidden the relationship well…a mother just knows. Lei had her housekeeper follow the woman and discovered she frequents the Stone Kettle (page 276).</a> Fearing she’d push her rebellious daughter further away, Lei did nothing, but now Rose is missing… could the mystery woman have something to do with it?</p>
