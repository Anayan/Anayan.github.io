<p class="s23" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Agni Kai</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Agni Kai is a ceremonial Firebender duel between two opponents, which technically ends when one op- ponent burns the other. It is often used as a high-stakes way to settle scores between two parties when one, or both, feels egregiously harmed by the other. It also con- firms a person’s social standing by proving one a better Firebender than the other. An Agni Kai is a grave matter and Firebenders don’t engage in the duel lightly—not only because it can be deadly, but because anything agreed upon based on the outcome of the duel must be upheld by the loser.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Any Firebender can be challenged to an Agni Kai, even the Fire Lord. However, this rarely happens as Fire Lords are supremely powerful Firebenders who are not often known for their mercy.</p>

<a name="bookmark31">The Air Nomads</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prior to the Hundred Year War, all Air Nomads were Airbenders. They lived in harmony with their sky bison and valued pacifism, often choosing to maintain distance from the rest of the world’s conflicts. Many lived nomadic lives and traveled the world, while others stayed attached to one of their four Air Temples. They lived according to monastic traditions, and the Northern and Southern Air Temples acted as homes for Air Monks while the Eastern and Western Air Temples acted as homes for Air Nuns. All Airbenders grew up to become monks and nuns unless they chose to leave the Air Nomad life behind or were exiled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Even before the first Avatar came into the world, the Air Nomads interacted with spirits regularly and lived in peace with them. That early connection with the Spirit World continued to manifest itself in the Airbenders’ relationship with spirits. Avatar Yangchen, an Avatar born into the Air Nomads, acted as a dip- lomat and negotiator in matters regarding the Spirit World, and struck several deals with spirits to maintain peace between them and the human world during her time. Once she passed, it was the Air Nomads’ responsibility to keep up these arrangements, or else risk offending destructive spirits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the beginning of the Hundred Year War, Fire Lord Sozin orchestrated a genocide that wiped out all the Air Nomads except for Avatar Aang. Much of the Air Nomads’ history and culture was lost during the war, but Avatar Aang worked to revive it after the war’s conclusion along with the help of the Air Acolytes, a group of people devoted to learning Air Nomad traditions. These Air Acolytes restored the temples and looked after them. Then, after Harmonic Convergence during the Korra Era and Korra’s decision</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to keep the spirit portals open, many non-benders across the world suddenly gained airbending abilities, joining together under the guidance of Aang’s son, Tenzin, to create a new Air Nation dedicated to bringing balance to the world.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Northern Air Temple</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A towering temple only accessible through the air</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Northern Air Temple is located in the mountains in the north of the Earth Kingdom and exclusively housed Air Monks for much of history. The Air Nomads constructed the temple to best harness the natural flows of air and wind, as seen in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">design of its big hallways. The surrounding area is mountainous, and to the north there is ocean and then, quite a ways off, the Northern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">During the Hundred Year War, a group of Earth Kingdom refugees, including a man known as the Mechanist, made the Northern Air Temple their home and installed many new inventions there. The Fire Nation forced the Mechanist to create weapons for its military, but eventually the inventor ended up assisting the defeat of the Fire Nation. After the Hundred Year War, his inventions were moved elsewhere. The temple saw the return of Airbenders following Harmonic Convergence when many of the new Airbenders went to the Northern Air Temple to train. Sadly, the Red Lotus destroyed the temple during Ava- tar Korra’s time in their attempt to capture and kill her.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eastern Air Temple</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A temple of significant spiritual power</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Eastern Air Temple was one of the two temples that housed only Air Nuns for most of its existence. Situated across three adjacent mountains in the southeast of the Earth Kingdom, the pagodas on each mountain are connected by bridges, and the temple includes sky bison stables. Though the most badly dam- aged of the four temples during the Air Nomad Genocide, this temple was repaired by Avatar Aang and the Air Acolytes after the conclusion of the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Out of all the four temples, the Eastern Air Temple has the most spiritual power and significance. Dragonfly bunny spirits fa- vor the area, and there is a meditation circle near the temple. This circle is a spiritual hotspot that attracted a swarm of dark spirits during the years it went neglected. Once Avatar Korra cleansed it, Jinora, a highly skilled Airbender, used the meditation circle to help guide Korra into the Spirit World for the first time.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Southern Air Temple</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Air Nomad temple home to flying lemurs and sky bison</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Air Temple is one of the two temples to exclusive- ly house Air Monks and is located in the Patola Mountain Range in the South Sea. The temple has beautiful open gardens, an airball arena, twisting paths, and statues of past Avatars. One of the other special features of this temple is that it has some doors that can only be opened via airbending. It is also Avatar Aang’s childhood home; shortly after he ran away from it, the Fire Nation raided the temple and killed all its inhabitants, including Aang’s beloved mentor, Monk Gyatso. Prior to the Hundred Year War, the temple had been home to many flying lemurs and a healthy population of sky bison, all of whom returned after its restoration. When the Air Acolytes fully repaired the temple, they installed a statue of Avatar Aang as an addition, as well as several other new buildings.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Western Air Temple</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An upside-down mountain temple located in a strategically important location</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Western Air Temple is the childhood home of Avatar Yang-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">chen and housed only Air Nuns. Built beneath a cliff as though the buildings were hanging upside down, this temple is particu- larly difficult to find if you don’t know where to look. It is located in the mountains north of the Fire Nation, specifically north of the Sun Warriors’ ancient city. The Western Air Temple looks very intimidating, but it also has fun elements like a sky bison obstacle course, a racetrack, and a giant Pai Sho table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark59" class="s22">Like the other Air Temples, the Western Air Temple was raided during the Air Nomad Genocide, though it suffered minimal damage. However, it was partly destroyed toward the end of the Hundred Year War when Aang took refuge there with his friends, first by the explosive attacks of a Firebender assassin and then by Azula’s (page 64)</a> forces. Like the other temples, the Western</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Air Temple was eventually restored by the Air Acolytes after the end of the Hundred Year War.</p>
