<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you have a group focus to direct your game, and a sketch of your story’s pilot episode, it’s time to meet the stars of the series—you! Each player creates a character linked to the group focus you just created—a skilled, competent hero with plenty</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to learn and a desire to change the world for the better. You can create any kind of character you can imagine! Over the course of their journey, your character grows, learns new abilities, and shifts between two opposing beliefs at the heart of their story.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Choosing a Playbook</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, you’re going to choose a playbook—an outline of a charac- ter archetype which you can customize to make your own. Like in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, each play- er character in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>possesses a specialized skill set and grapples with a particular story arc. Your playbook represents these core elements through your abilities, your balance principles, and other features on the sheet. There are ten playbooks to choose from in this book: the <span class="s20">Adamant</span>, the <span class="s20">Bold</span>, the <span class="s20">Guardian</span>, the <span class="s20">Hammer</span>, the <span class="s20">Icon</span>, the <span class="s20">Idealist</span>, the <span class="s20">Pillar</span>, the <span class="s20">Prodigy</span>, the <span class="s20">Rogue</span>, and the <span class="s20">Successor.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Everyone (except the GM) chooses one of these playbooks to create their character. Each playbook can only be used by one player. This is because each playbook is more than a collection of powers—they give each character specific tools and challenges tailored to their individual themes, in order to help each player tell a certain kind of story and differentiate their character from the other companions in your campaign. Imagine if there were two Kataras in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>! If you and another player want the same playbook, talk with each other to find the best solution and ask the GM for alternative suggestions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Choosing a playbook doesn’t mean you’re locked into play- ing a specific character—it’s a foundation on which to build. That foundation might be the same for everyone who chooses to play the Bold, but no two Bold characters look the same— even though they have the same principles! As your charac- ter develops, they gain new talents and skills, learn combat techniques, and even shift their worldview towards one ideal over another. Whether you’re playing your character just once or across multiple sessions, make sure the themes, issues, and abilities they deal with are exciting to you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s possible to eventually change playbooks, moving from one set of story arcs, conflicts, and skill sets to another. Usually this only happens at the end of a long story arc, but there are times where you might find your character’s story changing dramatically before the group’s overall story reaches a point of resolution. In those cases, you might grow into a new playbook…or find that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a new character is a better fit for the new stories you want to tell. You can check out <span class="s20">Chapter 7: Advancement </span>to learn more about how your character might grow and change and <span class="s20">Chapter 9: Sea- sons &amp; Campaigns </span>to read more about how to change playbooks if you reach that point!</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Playbooks</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your character’s playbook defines what role they fill in the group and how that role relates to the conflicts that drive them. A play- book helps you define your character’s personality, relationships, and even how they fight. Any of the playbooks can bend one of the four elements—there’s no “bender” playbook—but they don’t have to in order to be a hero! Think about the kind of char- acter you want and compare it to the themes of each playbook. If you’re not sure which playbook fits your vision best, ask the GM or the group for suggestions!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Character Concept</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After choosing your playbook, it’s a good idea to have the full character concept percolating in the back of your head. Before you make any choices, consider how everything ties together— essentially, what the one-sentence description of your character might be. Making your character fully come together—so that their high <span class="s49">Passion </span>and their waterbending and their urban back- ground all add up to a whole—is one of the biggest jobs you have during character creation. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you move forward:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part49.htm#bookmark97" class="s22">First, think about how your character is tied to the scope, group focus, and inciting incident you just created. If your group’s goal is to defeat a dangerous foe, did your character previously lose every- thing to that foe and now seeks revenge? If your scope is narrowed down to a single village, were they born and raised there or were they passing through from elsewhere and got caught up in the incit- ing incident? Don’t worry about answering these questions in detail yet—you’ll fill in these details when you get to your history ques- tions (page 119).</a> For now, a rough idea can give you guidance!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Also consider the era your group chose and use that to guide your concept. Maybe you’re interested in connecting your char- acter to an organization or event in your chosen era. Remember that certain kinds of bending, technology, and even cultures</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark54" class="s22">are either more common or less common from era to era—the way Air Nomads are absent during the Hundred Year War (page 58).</a> As you think about your character, make sure they con- nect to the era as much as the group focus and incident.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Develop a strong connection between the character and the goal you’ve decided on. If your character doesn’t match the focus, scope, or incident, they might still be an interesting hero, but they’ll struggle to fit into the group and <i>this </i>game’s story. If you have a character you’re enthusiastic to play, but are unsure of how to fit them into the game—talk to the GM and other players about how you can tie your concept back to the focus and incident.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Concept or Playbook First?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In tabletop roleplaying games and storytelling, much of the time you create a “character concept,” something like a simple one-sen- tence outline of a character like “Waterbending former fisher- man turned warrior” or “Ex-Fire Nation soldier seeking to make amends.” Having a good character concept can be a real boon to figuring out a character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">So, should you come up with a character concept, and then choose a playbook to match? Or should you choose a playbook and let it guide your entire character concept?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Either way can work, but try to choose your playbook first and let it guide you. Playbooks are designed to help create interesting characters, but they also guide you toward making choices that fit the issues and arc of that playbook. In other words, they’re designed to guide you to make characters who have plenty of dramatic heft for a full campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you prefer to tailor a playbook to a pre-existing character concept, be aware that can hit some weird, surprising, and un- expected roadblocks…but if you’re up for the challenge, go for it! Just keep in mind that everything on the playbook, including the questions asked to fill in the character’s backstory, is there to help create characters who perfectly fit <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories.</p>
