<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do I Have to Fight?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">You might have noticed we refer to your character as both a companion and a warrior. Every player character in <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is competent and trained to fight—that’s part of what makes them a hero. The world of <i>Avatar </i>is full of conflict and action, and martial arts in their various forms, from hand-to-hand combat to the bending arts, are an important part of the world’s stories. Your char- acter <i>will </i>get into a fight during their journey at some point.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">This doesn’t mean your character has to like fighting! Fight- ing isn’t just about aggression and causing harm—it’s also about self-defense and protecting others. Your character can participate in combat exchanges without landing a sin- gle blow yourself, perhaps using Test Balance to frustrate an opponent into losing their cool or creating obstacles for your enemies and advantages for your friends.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Most importantly, while combat is expected in <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, fights don’t end in death. Sometimes you will run opponents off without filling their fatigue, conditions, or balance tracks, and sometimes you can resolve a conflict with words after a single exchange of blows. When your character inflicts injury on others, they might want to hurt them—but your characters aren’t killers. The world of <i>Avatar </i>doesn’t shy away from the idea of death but outright murder isn’t something your com- panions do (and if they do, it changes their lives forever).</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">It’s always possible for a character or NPC to die during the game, but these moments should have serious weight, only happen with the entire group’s consent, and never occur as a frivolous consequence.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Combat Technique</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each hero in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is a trained warrior of some kind and starts their adventure with some extra <span class="s20">advanced techniques </span>that they can use in combat exchanges. These advanced techniques can be used in place of (or in addition to) the basic techniques, depending on your stance move results.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If you’re playing a single session game, start with a single <span class="s20">mastered </span>technique.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If you’re creating a character for a full campaign, start with one mastered technique and one <span class="s20">learned </span>technique.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part84.htm#bookmark164" class="s22">For more on basic techniques and learned, practiced, or mastered advanced techniques, see page 211.</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You have acquired your starting advanced techniques through lots of practice and training. How did you learn it and from whom? What does it say about your character and how they approach conflicts?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Choose your starting advanced techniques from your playbook’s own advanced technique and all other techniques available to your skills and training. Each playbook has their own unique combat technique that they can choose, representing the combat style and theme of that type of hero. The Guardian can Divert attacks against their allies to take the blows themselves, while the Hammer can Overwhelm enemies, causing them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to suffer emotion and exhaustion. However, instead of your playbook’s technique, you can choose one of several techniques (see Appendix A) based on your character’s fighting style. Your character always uses their training in combat but these style- based techniques demonstrate knowledge of a particular trick or signature maneuver that your hero is especially good at.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">By default, your playbook technique is your mastered choice, and you pick your learned technique from the rest of those available to you, but you may choose to adjust, modify, or swap these. Talk to the GM as you go to make sure everything you pick makes sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whichever techniques you choose, write them down on your playbook under <i>Combat Techniques </i>
<a href="part62.htm#bookmark122" class="s22">and mark each of the boxes labeled L (learned), P (practiced), and M (mastered) as appro- priate. A mastered technique has you marking all three boxes; a practiced technique just has the first two (learned and prac- ticed) marked; and a learned technique just has learned marked. During a combat exchange you can choose your techniques as appropriate based on your stance and your roll. For more infor- mation on exchanges and how to use techniques, see page 146.</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part84.htm#bookmark164" class="s22">The NPCs you meet during the game may know their own advanced techniques, and might use them against you (if they’re hostile) or be willing to teach them to you if they’re allies or you petition them. For more information on learning new tech- niques, see page 211.</a>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part59.htm#bookmark120" class="s22">At the end of every game session, the players discuss what their companions learned during the course of the episode. There are three questions everyone always answers—you can see those on page </a>142—but each playbook also has a question which only that character answers. Each “yes” answer allows you to check</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part83.htm#bookmark163" class="s22">a growth box. When you mark the fourth growth box, you ad- vance (page 210)</a> and choose one of the options under growth advancement. You don’t have any decisions to make here but consider what triggers this so you can play towards it. The rate at which your character advances and grows is in <i>your </i>hands!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Introducing Your Character</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone else has filled out most of their playbooks— everything except connections—it’s time to meet the rest of the companions who your character teamed up with during the inciting incident! Go around the table and introduce your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">character by name and describe their appearance, training, back- ground, demeanor, and answers to their history questions. As each player tells the group about their hero, this is a good time for everyone—especially the GM—to ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of each character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">During introductions you might get additional ideas about how each character fits into the inciting incident and its different plot points. That’s great! You can connect your companions to certain moments or aspects of those events, but you don’t need to detail everything. You can always flash back to those moments during play as you learn more about your companions and the world. The inciting incident has already happened and the most exciting parts of your characters’ stories are yet to come!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bringing the Cast Together</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you know who the rest of the group are, you can draw <span class="s20">connections </span>between your characters! Using what the other play- ers have told you, fill out both connections on your playbooks to link your character with two other companions. Each of your con- nections establishes a relationship between your hero and another character. They can represent long-standing ties (a family member, an old friend, a coworker/unit member, etc.) or they can reflect a dynamic that emerged between the two of you after meeting and joining forces during the inciting incident.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Take turns choosing one of your connections and offering it to another player whose character you think fits that relationship well (or would be fun to roleplay it with). If the player agrees, write their character’s name down in the relevant space on your playbook—you’re connected! Continue taking turns and mak- ing connections, giving everyone a chance to define your group’s relationships as you set out on your adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once all the players have finished each of these steps and you have connections with the other companions, you’re ready to play the game! Gather your gear, focus your energy, and prepare for the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
