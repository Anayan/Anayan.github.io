<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The different eras of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>provide a nearly infinite number of conflicts and obstables that can act as a seed for your own adventures.

<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you’re ever stuck for a new adventure, check out the hooks for your campaign’s era and see if anything might be a good fit!</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Three Lanterns Social Club</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a <i>daofei </i>group by the name of the Three Lanterns Social Club claims they want to join forces with the Flying Opera Com- pany to help the Avatar, the company is immediately suspicious. Kirima tasks the companions with infiltrating this fishy <i>daofei </i>group, asking them to identify their real leader and what their motives are. To do this, the group has to hide their identities as allies of the Flying Opera Company and pretend to do anything to join these seedy outlaws. Perhaps the Three Lanterns Social Club’s intentions are sincere, or perhaps their goal is to bring down the Avatar in order to make the Earth Kingdom safer for <i>daofei.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Splinter Fleet</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Navy is working hard to return people enslaved by the Fifth Nation to their homes, but there is one village whose resi- dents just can’t be tracked down. If the companions want to find these missing people, they must hunt down a splinter fleet of the Fifth Nation and get them to give up the location of the villagers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part25.htm#bookmark41" class="s22">Chukagnak’s (page 43)</a> fleet does not engage in slavery, but they were around when that crime was common in the Fifth Nation. Pirates don’t give out information for free however, so they may ask the group for something highly questionable in ex- change, such as help stealing from a dangerous target or finding loot lost in waters patrolled by the Fire Navy.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Prison</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part25.htm#bookmark40" class="s22">Tagaka (page </a>42) is the only person who knows the location</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of a person she enslaved that the players need information from. So the companions must break into the prison beneath Lake Laogai to speak with her. This is a nearly impossible task, but</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if the companions can sneak their way inside, trick the guards into thinking they have official business there, or get themselves arrested for some serious destruction, they just might have an in. The real challenge is getting back out again—since Tagaka will likely demand her freedom before she shares any information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And as for companions who don’t particularly feel like freeing someone who took slaves? They may need another creative solu- tion for getting information out of the dreaded pirate queen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Governor</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The young Governor Te Sihung has requested instruction in making better governing decisions, and the companions have been sent as his new mentors. Zigan Village now has a new school and herbal clinic that the poorest villagers have access to for free, but villages that have suffered like Zigan don’t recover with just a couple of changes. The village needs a lot of im- provements, and Te’s understanding of his role is paltry, even</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if it is improving. If the group cannot turn him into a fit leader, an opportunistic <i>daofei </i>named Meili may take advantage of the village’s vulnerability and seize control while the villagers are too disorganized to fight back.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Lost Air Nomad</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After exiling an Air Nomad named Tsewang for misdeeds she didn’t commit, the Council of Elders at the Eastern Air Temple realizes their mistake and sends the companions to go find the exiled nun. Unfortunately, she seems to have vanished into thin air. The companions have to do some sleuthing to discover that the Air Nun is trying to join a <i>daofei </i>organization, and if they don’t hurry to stop her she may truly never be able to return to the Eastern Air Temple.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Escape</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part24.htm#bookmark38" class="s22">When Lady Huazo (page 38)</a> escapes house arrest, the Keohso Clan tasks the companions with helping to track her down and bring her back. They are not only offering a boon with their clan, but cold hard cash as well. However, the Saowon Clan approaches the group shortly after and asks for their help bringing the escapee to safety so that she isn’t forced to live the rest of her life impris- oned. The group has to make a choice about whose side to take.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Besieged Outpost</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An outpost in the North Pole is besieged by dark spirits, and ren- egade warrior Kapena wants to be the one to free the outpost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If she does free them ahead of the warriors officially sent from the North, maybe it will be one step toward proving women are just as capable of being warriors as men. However, Kapena isn’t foolish enough to go alone and knows she needs help to liberate the outpost.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Renegade Merchant</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dawei, a Northern Water Tribe merchant, made a sport of antag- onizing Earth Kingdom troops as he skillfully slipped by them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to sell his wares in the Earth Kingdom…unfortunately Dawei’s fun was cut short when he was arrested in town for peddling his wares. Aden, Dawei’s girlfriend, needs help breaking her boyfriend out of jail and prefers not to go through traditional channels, which could take months.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Price of Water</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The well of a sandbending tribe on the edge of the Si Wong Des- ert has run dry and they’ve discovered a city nearby has tapped the underground reservoir, diverting water away from the desert. The tribespeople have tried negotiating with the city to halt their use of the reservoir until a mutually beneficial solution can be found, but were ignored. They’re looking for a diplomat who can help them…or an inventor who can give the city a taste of their own medicine.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Missing Nomad</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Air Monk named Mikyo went missing after traveling to the South Pole to learn what was causing the spirits to stir. The chief of the tribe closest to where the monk went missing told him not to go alone, but the young monk didn’t listen. Many Air Nomads in the south are busy helping with the seismic activity in the Earth Kingdom, and the tribe feels they did enough for someone who refused to listen to their good advice. The Air Nomads are looking for someone who could brave the storm and find the missing Mikyo.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Embarrassment</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Michi is the son of a famous Fire Nation general. He’s forsworn the wealth of his family and wants to live with the Air Nomads. Michi’s dad won’t let him go without a fight and Michi needs help getting to a Guiding Wind camp before the mercenaries his father hired catch up with him.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Operation Egg Rescue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of Fire Nation teenagers stole a dragon egg from a noble resting in camp after a successful hunt. The teens wanted to save the egg from the cruel fate of its parent…but forgot eggs often have two parents. A dragon is now actively hunting down its egg and the teenagers need help getting the egg back to its parent while avoiding getting eaten by an angry dragon or imprisoned by a furious noble.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Expedition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As visitors to Ba Sing Se University, the companions are secretly tasked by the esteemed Professor Ko with recovering relics from the Air Temples in an attempt to preserve Air Nomad culture.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, each temple has its own dangers and even traveling to them is a harrowing ordeal. Between Fire Army units, bandits, and dark spirits, retrieving the relics is no normal academic endeavor.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Leaving Home</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Residents of a small Earth Kingdom village must either fight back against the Fire Nation army sent to colonize them or rush to evacuate everyone to the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. Not everyone is willing to leave their homes and lives behind. Governor Luk, at his wits’ end trying to figure out what to do, desperately reaches out to the companions for help.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Secret War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions in Ba Sing Se must help their friend brain- washed by the Dai Li. He has been acting strangely after starting a demonstration to get the government to do more to help war refugees. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately), they have an ally in a conspiracy theorist named Wen Daosheng, but some</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of Wen’s theories are so wild that he even believes the missing Avatar might be the true leader of the Dai Li.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Snowstorm</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions are traveling through a part of the South Pole rumored to be plagued by dark spirits when they meet Mamnguq- sualuq, the leader of a settlement hidden in a cave system. She asks them for help, as they have a crisis on their hands. A Fire Navy ship is prowling Southern Water Tribe waters and sending scouts to look for nearby settlements, but one of the local kids is also missing in a snowstorm. She asks the group to deal with the ship while she and the other villagers go out to look for the child.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Loyalty</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Myeongsu of the Order of the White Lotus has tasked the com- panions with infiltrating the Fire Army as spies and saboteurs in order to slow down the Fire Nation’s progress toward the remote, defenseless village of Jaiyin. The problem is, if they disobey the Fire Nation’s orders to wreak havoc on the smaller villages, they may give away their true loyalties. Can the characters convince the Fire Nation of their loyalty without doing irreparable harm to Earth Kingdom citizens? Or will they have to give themselves away and go on the run, therefore abandoning their mission?</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Conservationist</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions must protect a member of the Southern Water Tribe named Kerlungner as she travels from village to village collecting stories and traditions so that they won’t die out. Unfor- tunately, one of the areas she needs to travel through is rumored to be cursed. A particularly treacherous stretch of coast where several Fire Navy ships were wrecked is now polluted with spilled oil and metal parts, which has caused a local spirit to become very unhap- py and attack anyone who ventures into its territory.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions have a sensitive task: transport Hama, a dangerous Waterbender, from a Fire Nation prison back to the Southern Water Tribe. Hama developed bloodbending after years in prison and used her abilities to abduct and imprison Fire Nation citizens, before she was captured. The Fire Nation agreed to give her to the Southern Water Tribe under the condition that she never again leave the capital. Unfortunately, angry Fire Nation veterans are determined to recapture Hama; she has every intention of fighting back.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Returning Home</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that the war is over, some village refugees are sick of the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se and want to return home. Unfortunately, their village was pillaged during the war, and now a large group of bandits lives in the ruins. In time, the refugees might garner aid from the au- thorities, but that might take years! Chungsuk, the former governor of the village, wants to launch a war against the bandits right now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions must aid Chungsuk and drive away the bandits if the old villagers are ever going to return to their homes.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Relic</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes have started on repairs to the Eastern Air Temple, but much of it has been ransacked. When Xing Ying gets a lead that someone has sold an important Nomad relic on the black market, the companions must track it down and steal it from the buyer with a good old-fashioned heist. Unfortunately, the relic is kept in a highly secure estate and guarded by a mixed group of criminal benders who call themselves the Poison Dart.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Northern Revenge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of people from the Northern Water Tribe deported from the South due to their colonialist agenda are determined to sabotage the Southern Reconstruction Project. They hope when the project fails without them, it will prove the Southern Water Tribe incapable of taking care of themselves or using the oil wisely. A suspicious Sokka asks the companions to uncover the Northerners’ plot and prevent this group from hurting the project.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Missing Students</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions must rescue a group of new Beifong Metalbending Academy students from bending supremacists. The kidnappers know a weak spot for Toph is her students, and seek to extort Earthen Fire Industries. Spies for the supremacists watch Toph and the other academy students, so it’s up to the companions to save the students from the talented benders holding them hostage.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Assassination</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pin-Yi, a local firebending prankster who does odd jobs for local criminals in the Fire Nation Capital, warns the companions about an impending assassination attempt on Iso, a high-ranking military official who supported Zuko’s rise to power. Pin-Yi has been trying to warn any adult for weeks, but no one believes him because he’s a notorious prankster. The assassination plot is real enough, but is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">only a distraction—an excuse for the Fire Warriors to incite a riot in the capital and bring Zuko’s reign into question once again.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Race</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a Cabbage Corp blimp crashes out at sea, accusations about who is truly responsible abound. Cabbage Corp believes they’ve been sabotaged, while some people at Future Industries believe Cabbage Corp is trying to frame them. Asami, however, believes that something more sinister may be going on—somebody wants the companies at each other’s throats. The companions must find survivors and uncover who is really responsible for the incident, as it becomes clear soon enough that it was no accident.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Election</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Earth Kingdom state wants to hold an election in a small province that has widely expressed interest in electing a repre- sentative, but militant royalists want to put a stop to it. They are even willing to assassinate the campaigning politicians in order to do so. King Wu tasks the companions with preventing any would-be assassins or saboteurs from derailing the election.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">A Worried Groom</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Akar, a famous Northern Water Tribe mover star, just came out as gay and announced his marriage to his long-time boyfriend Jieren. The two plan to get married in a big star-studded wedding in the North; Desna and Eska are even rumored to have RSVP’d!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, the notoriety of the wedding has resulted in the couple getting numerous death threats, one of which threatens their wed- ding day itself. Akar needs someone to get to the bottom of who could be threatening his and his future husband’s life.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Last Village Standing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Doi Village in the Earth Kingdom has survived centuries of hard- ship and needs help recovering from the events of the past few years, but the villagers don’t trust outsiders. The companions go to provide aid to this community, but its leader, Ganzaya, insists that dark spirits are at the root of the issue. Sure enough, soon after the companions arrive, they are plagued by mysterious attacks and accidents. Do the local spirits truly have something against outsid- ers, or are the villagers trying to drive the companions away?</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Airbender</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Airbender is committing serious crimes while dressed like an Air Nomad, which gives the actual Air Nomads a bad reputation they must mend. Tenzin tasks the companions with tracking down and recruiting this Air Nomad imposter. Tenzin has never met this Airbender and maybe they can be set on the right path after learning Nomad traditions. What makes this challenge particularly unique is the criminal is difficult to track by land and shows up seemingly out of nowhere to launch their attacks.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Informant</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nomin, a member of the Scarlet Sword Triad in Republic City, has agreed to testify against his criminal employers in exchange for a new life in one of the Four Nations. The problem is, the Scarlet Swords aren’t about to let him get away. The companions must escort Nomin to his new residence and set him up in a new, low-key life that has nothing to do with crime.</p>
