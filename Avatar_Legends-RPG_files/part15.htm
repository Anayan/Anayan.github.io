</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Four Nations are the stage for constantly changing conflicts, alliances, and adventures. Each era impacts the next, building on foundations laid thousands of years ago. Though the nations un- dergo many major shifts throughout history, there are locations that remain largely consistent no matter what era you play in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The lands of Avatar Legends are wondrous and diverse. They range from scorching hot to bitterly cold and the people who live in each land have adapted to their natural surroundings by either living alongside nature or overcoming its obstacles. Each Nation is geo- graphically unique and comes with its own set of natural wonders.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Water Tribes </span>primarily exist in the frigid North and South poles. Both poles are frozen landscapes where snow, sleet, and freezing temperatures are the norm. Little grows in either pole and the tribespeople hunt, forage, and trade for sustenance. Snowy mountains dot both the North and South and both tribes use the sea as a primary mode of transportation between different towns and villages. The Foggy Swamp tribespeople are an exception to their waterbending cousins, inhabiting a damp, warm swamp within the Earth Kingdom where strong spiritual energy (and water) ties them to the impressive flora in the area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Earth Kingdom </span>is the largest nation and has the most varied landscape. From scorching deserts, to frozen mountains, to rolling hills, to balmy beaches. How people in the Earth King- dom contend with its nature is dependent on the region. Larger Earth Kingdom cities are marvels of architecture and technology no matter what era you visit them in. However, many areas suffer from poor infrastructure; the Kingdom is too large—and the leaders often too corrupt—for full oversight and development of poorer regions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Fire Nation </span>is a series of islands to the west of the Earth Kingdom with numerous volcanoes. The climate ranges from pleasantly warm to scorching hot with many beautiful tropical beaches to visit on the various islands. Many of the Fire Nation volcanoes between the mountainous regions of the islands are active in every era. The warm weather suits the nation’s Fire- benders just fine and over the years inventors have developed many different ships for people to navigate between the islands.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Air Nomads </span>(or <span class="s20">Air Nation </span>in the Korra Era) are a nomadic people, but have four temples located at the edges of the map, each named after the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. Most Air Nomad temples are located in high, rocky locations that are hard to reach for anyone except Airbenders, sky bison, and other flying creatures. Though the temples are built in mountainous areas, they are far from devoid of life, with many pockets of beautiful greenery and ancient trees welcoming any number of local species.</p>

<a name="bookmark26">The Water Tribes</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes are two distinct tribes living at the northern and southern poles of the world; for most of human history, both were governed by the Northern Water Tribe. They are not only united by political bonds, but also by a shared spiritual heritage and water- bending. Additionally, a smaller settlement of Waterbenders lives in seclusion in a part of the Earth Kingdom called Foggy Swamp. Each group has its own traditions, values, and waterbending styles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Over the years, the two polar tribes have harbored tension between them and the chaos of the Hundred Year War only ag- gravated that tension. During the war, the Northern and Southern Tribes stopped communicating with one another, isolating the Southern Water Tribe. With fewer resources and weaker political structures, the Southern Tribe was eventually devastated by the Fire Nation’s relentless attacks. The war’s end did not resolve the problem; Northerners arrived to assist the Southerners with re- construction, but viewed them as incapable of properly governing themselves, and the Southerners’ resentment grew into a national- ist movement. During the Korra Era, this escalated into a civil war between the tribes, ending with the Southern Water Tribe finally gaining independence from the North.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Both Water Tribes are known for being resourceful survi-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vors, and since both poles experience extremely cold weather, outsiders may struggle when visiting either of the two tribes. Firebenders have the hardest time in the coldest reaches of the poles, especially during the harsh winds and snowfall. Even locals aren’t immune to freezing to death or getting lost in the ice should a bad storm roll in, but visitors are the most in danger due to their unfamiliarity with the area.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Agna Qel’a</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A city of ice with impenetrable walls housing the spirits of Moon and Ocean</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Agna Qel’a is the capital of the Northern Water Tribe. It is a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">massive port city built into an ice wall in the North Pole and situated on the shore of the Northern Sea. Towering walls of ice and a network of moats keep invaders at bay. In addition, it is home to a skilled army, waterbending warriors, and some of the best healers in the world. Canoes steered by Waterbenders ferry people from one location to another via the massive canals all throughout the city.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Royal Palace is the largest and highest structure in Agna Qel’a. It’s a multi-tiered structure surrounded by numerous waterfalls that feed into the canals of the city. The impressive balance of architecture and ice throughout this ancient city is a wonder to behold.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The lush and verdant Spirit Oasis hidden within the city is the single most important spiritual location to the Northern Water Tribe. Its thriving, tropical environment is completely un- like the rest of the North Pole, and is said to be nurtured by the energy of Tui, the Moon Spirit, and La, the Ocean Spirit. The two spirits live in a small pond within it as two koi fish constant- ly circling each other. After the era of Wan, the first Avatar, the first Waterbenders learned bending from observing the power of the moon over the ocean, and so these two spirits hold great significance to the tribe. During the full moon, people make offerings of food to Tui and La.</p>

<a name="bookmark27">Wolf Cove</a>
</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The capital of the South Pole struggling to find its identity amidst turmoil</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Wolf Cove is the Southern Water Tribe’s capital and has under-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gone some extreme changes throughout history. It struggled economically during the Kyoshi Era, was nearly destroyed during the Hundred Year War, then grew significantly during the Southern Reconstruction Project in the Aang Era, and endured occupation by the Northern Water Tribe during the civil war of the Korra Era. During its reconstruction after that occupation, the city gained a waterbending school and a royal palace. After all those changes, it had grown so much it was hardly recogniz- able as the original Capital City of eras long past. A Council of Elders governed the tribe and city for much of history, though the Northern Water Tribe sat at the head of the power hierarchy until the Southern Water Tribe gained its independence.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foggy Swamp</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An isolated water tribe who can bend the water in plants</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Foggy Swamp is located in the southwest of the Earth King- dom and is the home of a group of Waterbenders who settled there long ago. The swamp grew from an ancient banyan-grove tree that now stands in the center of the region, its roots reach- ing out far into the distance. The swamp is a spiritual destination as people often experience visions while traveling between its roots and over its waters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Waterbenders who live in the Foggy Swamp practice plantbending, a form of waterbending in which they tap into the moisture inside plants to manipulate them. Through plantbend- ing, people can take control of vines to entangle opponents or extract water out of large plants to use in a waterbending attack. During the full moon, Plantbenders can manipulate bigger plants such as large trees.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">For many years, the Foggy Swamp Waterbenders lived in se- cret, away from the constant politics of the Four Nations. Avatar Aang and his friends encountered their community at the end of the Hundred Year War, exposing them to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spirit Portals</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Portals to the Spirit World located at either pole</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part20.htm#bookmark33" class="s22">Both the North and South pole each have their own spirit por- tal—a physical gateway to the Spirit World. When open, these portals appear as giant beams of light shooting upwards from the ground towards the sky, with the Northern spirit portal glowing red and the Southern portal glowing white. Each is located in a wild forest, which thrives off residual spiritual energy, deep in the wilderness of its respective pole. Travelling to either spirit portal is exceedingly difficult, because of the harsh frozen land- scape of the poles. Even the most skilled survivalists of the Water Tribes wouldn’t make the trek unless such a journey was of the utmost importance and many take this as a sign to leave the spirits at peace. The portals were closed by Avatar Wan, but were reopened many years later by Avatar Korra. You can read more about the spirit portals—and the Spirit World—on page 29.</a>
