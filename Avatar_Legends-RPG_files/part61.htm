</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you’ve seen how moves work, and have a sense of what the basic, playbook, and balance moves do, you might be inter- ested in creating moves of your own, especially if you&#39;re the GM! All of the existing moves are designed to tie <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>together and reinforce the kinds of stories told about the Four Nations and its young heroes. When you make a custom move, you can refine those tools into moves specific to the kind of story you and your group want to tell. Whether it’s adding a move unique to a location or a move suited to specific kinds of social interactions, creating custom moves can add specificity to your game. This section helps explain how to do all that. Primarily, this section is for GMs—players will very rarely, if ever, invent their own custom moves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">When to use Custom Moves</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The core moves of this game can see you through a vast array of situations—you won’t <i>need </i>a custom move to resolve something like a fight or a negotiation because the basic moves already do</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a lot of that work. Custom moves, then, are for when you <i>want </i>something more suited to an individual situation. They’re for times when the situation is specific enough, different enough, and interesting enough to warrant a more focused move to resolve some uncertainty.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Maybe there’s a bending exam you want to make more interest- ing than just seeing how players <span class="s8">rely on their skills and training</span>—a custom move can make that moment more dynamic and specific, allowing you to even differentiate between a bending exam at a Firebender Academy and a traditional coming-of-age test in the Air Nation. Sometimes you want moves to represent important locations in your game as well, like a move that triggers when players travel through the Foggy Swamp and encounter its natural hazards or spiritual whispers reflecting their psyches. In all these cases, your custom move is bringing something particular to life with new and interesting consequences all its own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But just as important as having an interesting situation for the move is having a fundamental uncertainty for the move to resolve. Each custom move needs to <i>move </i>the story forward in an interesting way and resolve some real uncertainty—if it’s not interesting or the outcome doesn’t push the story forward</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by resolving uncertainty, it probably doesn’t need to be a move and can just happen in the fiction. When something becomes a move, it’s important to the game because it has rules attached to it and the outcome of the move changes the fiction and the stakes of play in a new, challenging, or exciting way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, if there are no interesting outcomes of those bending tests, or if the results are guaranteed, then there’s no uncertainty—you wouldn’t use a basic move to resolve the situation and you certainly don’t need a custom move. If the PCs are being guided safely through the Foggy Swamp by locals, then maybe there is no uncertainty about navigating the dangers of the Swamp…but there might still be uncertainty about whatever spiritual connections or messages the PCs receive while jour- neying through the swamp.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you can’t identify both the uncertainty that the custom move is meant to resolve and the interesting situation that makes the custom move fun and compelling then you probably don’t need a custom move. Either one of the core moves of the game can resolve the situation, or the GM can just say what happens in the fiction. But if the situation is interesting, and there is some key uncertainty, and the core moves don’t quite resolve the uncertainty clearly, then the GM might want to invent a custom move for the situation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, think of custom moves as adding an exclamation point to a moment in the game, really drawing attention to it and making every player sit up and take notice. Adding a custom move for a particular element highlights it! The idea should already be interesting enough to support that attention. The key here is that if something is happening that you really want to draw attention to, to make a significant moment of impact, and it has the appropriate interesting qualities and uncertainty—then a custom move is perfect!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, imagine that an Airbender PC is trying to earn their tattoos, and they face one final test. That test could proba- bly be resolved by the results of <span class="s8">rely on skills and training</span>. But it’s also the perfect moment for a custom move! The test is certainly interesting and exciting, a real moment of focus for that charac- ter and that culture. There is definitely uncertainty—not simply whether or not the character passes, but <i>why </i>the character might pass or fail, and what they might have to do next as a result. So when the GM creates a custom move to resolve the test, it fits the needs of the game perfectly!</p>

</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Building Custom Moves</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Generally speaking, a move has the following components:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• A trigger: “When <u>&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> happens…”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• An outcome: “…<u> &nbsp; </u> happens.” This could involve rolling the dice but it can also just give hold or involve choosing options from a list instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• Stakes: If the move <i>does </i>require rolling the dice, you need to define what happens on each of the possible outcomes—a 10+, a 7–9, and a 6-.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For that last part, remember that a 10+ means things go pretty well (sometimes flawlessly), a 7–9 means it generally works but with some kind of cost or complication, and a 6- means things get worse or even more complicated. A 6- doesn’t always mean failure—it could mean you do what you wanted, but you overdo it or make things worse in the process!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Aside from the mechanics listed above, remember once more that any custom move needs to fit these criteria in order to be a move at all:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The move needs to trigger when attempting an interesting, risky, or uncertain action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The move needs to create or lead to outcomes that push the game’s fiction forward.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Trigger</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">trigger </span>of a move determines when you turn to it; it’s what happens in the game that activates the game mechanics. A trigger needs to be clear and explicit about when it happens—if it’s too generic, it’ll either be triggered constantly (which can slow the game down or lead to chaos, depending on its outcomes) or the game will fall apart as people argue when that move is or isn’t triggered. “When you <span class="s8">airbend</span>…” isn’t good because it triggers constantly every time you use your airbending to do anything.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The action that triggers the move also has to be interesting too! “When you <span class="s8">airbend</span>…” isn’t particularly exciting because you can already perform simple airbending tasks if you’re an Airbender!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The trigger also needs to involve some kind of uncertainty—if we know what will happen when you do something, or there isn’t any kind of ambiguity about an action’s outcome, it either happens outright or the GM makes a move to reflect that obvious outcome. “When you <span class="s8">airbend</span>…” doesn’t have any stakes, and it’s too generic so it could cover both simple actions and extremely complex ones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The more specific you can be about when and how a move triggers, under exciting or interesting circumstances with unknown outcomes, the stronger your custom move will be. “When you <span class="s8">air- bend</span>…” is too open-ended, but refining it to something like “When you <span class="s8">use airbending alone to fly with your glider </span>through danger or avoid obstacles…” makes it much clearer about <i>what </i>needs to hap- pen in the fiction (airbending flight), <i>when </i>it happens (flying with the glider), and notes the uncertainty (danger or obstacles).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The trigger is especially important to a custom move because it tells everyone something very specific is now important to the scope and focus of your particular game. Its existence means those fictional circumstances will come up much more often than if the move didn’t exist, and the players will come to care about resolving their outcomes in this specific way.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Outcome</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the trigger for the move, you need to know what happens as a result of the move—what are the PCs trying to accomplish and what are the action’s results and effects? The outcome(s) of a move can be a singular effect or come from a list of options, but however it’s decided, it needs to change the situation or open up an avenue for new challenges and storytell- ing. If a move’s outcome doesn’t change the game world or the story in some way, it needs to be stronger. A move’s outcomes should always provide a way forward or lead to further action. If it doesn’t, then the move isn’t a move or it doesn’t need to exist.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Let’s say that Pai Sho has become an important part of your game and you want to make a custom move around it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">You start with the move:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">When you play an opponent in Pai Sho, roll with <span class="s49">Focus</span>. On a 10+, you win handily. On a 7–9, it’s a close game but you win; mark a condition. On a miss, you lose.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This move doesn’t really change the state of the game with its outcomes, unless winning or losing the game has some truly serious stakes that come with it. It’s also not particularly interest- ing! All that happens is you win or lose the game, possibly at the cost of a condition. This move might be resolved by <span class="s8">relying on your skills and training </span>if you know Pai Sho well enough and it’s important to know if you win or not; the outcome of the game could also be resolved metaphorically, like winning an argument and making a winning move in the fiction at the same time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Maybe what’s really important about Pai Sho in your game is its social aspect and the use of the game as a vehicle for social</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dueling and reading others. With that in mind, here’s an alternate trigger: “When you <span class="s8">study an NPC opponent during a game of Pai Sho</span>, roll with <span class="s49">Harmony</span>.” The effects also need to change to match the new intent—studying an opponent through play by observing not just their tactics but their behaviors and mannerisms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">So the outcome becomes:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you study an NPC opponent during a game of Pai Sho, roll with <span class="s49">Harmony</span>. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">1. While playing this game, spend hold—1-for-1—on one of these options:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Exchange banter over simple plays. Ask them a question about what’s on their mind; they must answer honestly or mark 1-fatigue. Then they ask you a question and you must answer honestly or mark 1-fatigue as before.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Ask a leading question and lay a trap for them in the game. Their response to your guile reveals something about their personality or reveals their principle.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Pressure them with words and make an aggressive play. If you know their principle, mark 1-fatigue to shift their balance away from center by questioning or challenging their beliefs or perspective.</p>

<p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Order #33482721)</p>

</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What makes this revision stronger is how it affects the frame- work of your game. The move is no longer about just winning or losing; it’s about understanding your opponent. It makes the winning or losing more metaphorical by connecting gameplay</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the ebb and flow of bantering and throwing barbs as you place game tiles. Each outcome also changes the flow of the game somehow—you trade information and states of mind with the NPC, learn what they believe in, or make a power play in the moment, each of which leads to new situations and challenges.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are several common types of outcomes:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Direct, instant effects: </span>When this move triggers, something happens that changes the game’s fiction without involving other mechanics in its resolution. These effects might most often be purely fictional but they could determine how the rules are used in certain situations as well. Even if the move doesn’t explicitly set things up with game mechanics, it can still imply those situations with its fiction. For example, a move that gives or takes away an NPC’s trust sets up how PCs might be able to <span class="s8">plead </span>with them later (or not).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Shift balance: </span>Your move can result in shifting a target’s balance or shifting your own balance, depending on the situation (voluntarily or not). When a move results in shifting balance, it means that move is about reinforcing or challenging the target’s beliefs somehow. A move might offer flexibility or choice in how that person’s balance shifts in either direction, or in who decides how balance shifts. This move could instead only shift one’s balance away from or only towards their center. Either way, it needs to be clear which way balance shifts and what happens that causes the shift.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is the person making the move strengthening the target’s beliefs or trying to convince them of an opposing viewpoint?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Inflict or remove conditions: </span>Your move can inflict a condition on another PC or another target, depending on the format and intention of the move. If a move involves conditions, it should indicate and reflect the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">emotional stakes and situations in which the move applies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Moves that inflict conditions imply “harm,” although it isn’t physical—you’re taking an emotional blow or having your confidence shaken. On the other hand, a move that clears a condition implies comfort or rest.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Apply status effects: </span>Similar to a move that inflicts conditions, your move can result in applying one or more status effects to a PC or NPC. These moves should clearly outline the conditions in which these status effects apply and when or how they might be cleared (if the status doesn’t already specify an endpoint). For example, a move about falling into an ancient ruin’s trap could apply the <i>Doomed </i>status until the PC escapes. A location-based move for a region with a heavy rainy season could grant <i>Empowered </i>on Waterbenders and Airbenders for as long as the storm lasts.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Inflict or clear fatigue: </span>Your move can inflict fatigue if it involves some kind of harm, exhaustion, or strain as an</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">outcome. Your move can clear fatigue instead if it involves rest, recuperation, or some other form of relief. A move might</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inflict fatigue or affect how much fatigue is marked to represent environmental conditions (whenever you mark fatigue in extreme desert heat, mark an additional fatigue), or it could</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be a cost paid when making a move (mark 1-fatigue and roll with <span class="s49">a stat</span>). A move that inflicts or clears fatigue should</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be explicit about why and how a PC becomes more or less physically, mentally, or emotionally drained or worn down.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Choose options: </span>Your move can allow players to choose one or more results from a list of options. The number of choices might be static or they might be determined by the results of a roll (“On a 7–9, choose</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">one; on a 10+, choose two,” etc.). When a move provides options, the player making the move has more agency</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">in where the story goes next or how things shake out.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Gain and spend hold: </span>Your move can give players access to hold, which they can spend within a certain timeframe or situation on various benefits or fictional effects. This is similar to choosing from a list of options, except that it allows the player to parcel out the effects based on the context of the game (rather than making a more sweeping choice all at once).</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Stakes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A custom move needs to have stakes, especially if it involves rolling the dice. If the move doesn’t have any consequences or risks in- volved, why are we rolling instead of just narrating what happens or asking the GM to make a move? If a move doesn’t involve rolling the dice, how do things change or progress after the move resolves?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When thinking about the stakes of a move that involves rolling the dice, consider what it means to get a hit or a miss. As a general rule, a 10+ means that you get everything that you want or more than you set out to do; a 7–9 means you get some of what you want or have to deal with a complication or cost; and a miss means things go badly or the situation changes dramatically. When you create</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a move with these kinds of results, use the outcomes to shape the move’s results. If a move gives a player hold, a 10+ could give several hold while a 7–9 might only give one. That same move might in- stead only give one or two hold but a 10+ result might have an extra effect that a 7–9 result doesn’t. A move that lets a player choose from a list of options could give more than one choice on a hit with a fixed result on a miss, or it could let the player choose on a hit while the <i>target </i>of the move (or the GM) chooses the outcome on a miss.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If your move just happens without rolling dice, stakes are also important to consider—instead of finding out what happens with dice, you know what happens in the moment and you play to find out what happens after that. The move still needs to make a change to the world, either by affecting the people, the environment, or the narrative itself, to be a move. If a move’s outcome doesn’t change the game or do something interesting in the story, it either doesn’t need to be a move and can just happen through roleplay, or it needs to be stronger.</p>
