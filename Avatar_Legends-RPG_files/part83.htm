<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When your character has marked all four boxes of their growth track, you clear all four boxes and earn a growth advancement! The growth advancement comes into play immediately, provid- ing your PC with its benefits as soon as you earn it. Usually this happens at the end of the session, functionally between sessions, but even if it happens during play, the PC immediately gets access to the advancement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you aren’t sure exactly what to take, you don’t need to decide immediately, but you should take the advancement by the end of the next session at the absolute latest. Your character should evolve naturally over time instead of banking three or four advancements to be used all at once!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The growth advancements are listed on every playbook, along with boxes. Each time you take a growth advancement, mark one of those boxes; if there are no empty boxes, you can’t take that advancement anymore. The one exception is “Raising a stat by +1,” but you may only raise any stat to a maximum of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">+2 total through standard growth advancements. (Some moves from some playbooks let you raise a stat to +3 total.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This does mean eventually your character won’t be able to continue to earn growth advancements—and that’s okay! That signals they have already grown a great deal, and their story is likely coming to a close for <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These advancements let you take new moves from the <span class="s20">Moves </span>section of your or other playbooks. You can only take two more moves from your own playbook and two more moves from other playbooks. The two you take from other playbooks can come from any playbooks you choose—they don’t have to be the same one.</p>

<a href="part88.htm#bookmark169" class="s22">allows you to take that playbook’s special feature. The only way to get access to a play- book’s feature is to switch to that playbook (see page 218)!</a>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These advancements allow you to raise one of your stats— <span class="s49">Creativity</span>, <span class="s49">Focus</span>, <span class="s49">Harmony</span>, or <span class="s49">Passion</span>—by 1, to a maximum of +2. You can take this advancement many times, eventually raising every stat to +2—but that’ll take some time!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you want to raise a stat to +3, certain playbook moves allow you to raise a stat to +3—check out The Adamant, The Guardian, The Icon, The Pillar, and The Successor playbooks for those moves.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you take this advancement, you can immediately shift your center one step, any way you like! Remember that your center is your default, where your balance resets to when time passes. If your center ever goes past +3, then it’s time to retire or change your character. You could use this advancement to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part88.htm#bookmark170" class="s22">shift your center past +3 if you wanted, functionally bringing the story of your character (at least as this particular playbook) to a close—see more on page 219.</a>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you take this advancement, you gain the ability to use your Moment of Balance! Every playbook has its own Moment of Balance, a description of the way that playbook reaches a state of powerful, true balance, combining its principles into</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a greater whole. You can only use that Moment of Balance when you have unlocked it through this advancement and your balance is at your center during play. If your balance is off your center, you can’t use your Moment of Balance even if you have unlocked it!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part49.htm#bookmark98" class="s22">After you’ve used your Moment of Balance, you can still take this advancement a second time to unlock it again, allowing you to use it once more. You can read more about Moments of Balance on page 121.</a>
