<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part107.htm#bookmark200" class="s22">Preparing an adventure usually involves sitting down before each session and thinking through the key elements; starting a cam- paign, on the other hand, means thinking about how you want to focus your story, present the game to your players, and portray antagonists across many sessions! Running a campaign is more involved than running a single, isolated adventure—often called a one-shot (page </a>249)—but it can be a deeply rewarding experi- ence. Subtle shifts in the PCs’ balance tracks build up over time into shifting centers and dramatic decisions; ongoing adventures give players opportunities to use their Moments of Balance and advance their characters; and recurring antagonists may even allow the companions to convince a long-time foe to switch sides!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Some campaigns only last a few short sessions—perhaps two</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part46.htm#bookmark92" class="s22">to four episodes—and center primarily on the group focus the players chose at the start of play (page 110).</a> However, some campaigns last longer, the episodes coming together into a <span class="s20">sea- son </span>that has its own finale and resolution. Running any length of campaign requires you to think carefully about how you set up and start your story, but longer campaigns also require you to structure and manage the fiction between sessions, hoping to emerge over time with a cohesive whole.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This chapter covers these challenges, both giving you prac- tical tips on what you need to start a successful campaign and helping you understand how to create characters, conflicts, and exciting conclusions that make longer seasons feel worthy of the Avatarverse.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Your First Session</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The players have a fairly clear, focused job for the first session: they choose their playbooks and fill them out, selecting their moves and techniques and filling out their features. As the GM, you have a tougher job—to create a believable slice of the Avatarverse that <span class="s20">ensures the world feels real</span>, while filling that slice of the world with conflicts that <span class="s20">make the PCs’ stories</span>
</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">meaningful and important<span class="p">, and also </span>playing to find out what happens<span class="p">. It might feel like more work than tracking down an otter-penguin in the snowiest tundra!</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But have no fear—while the players set up their characters, you’re setting up everything you need to start playing without plan- ning anything. In fact, setting up the game gives you everything you need for a single session of play or even a whole campaign!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">You do most of your work setting up the game together with your group, but you need to take care of a few things before you sit down (or get on an online call) with your players.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Materials and Prep</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing in person, print out all the playbooks you want to offer to the players, and make sure you have a broad idea of their balance tracks, moves, and features. You don’t have to offer every playbook—maybe you don’t want to deal with the Successor’s family or the Pillar’s squad in your story—but take the time to un- derstand the ones you make available. Also print out enough basic moves sheets for yourself and every other player. You might want to provide everyone at the table a copy of the <i>Campaign Creation Worksheet</i>, but at minimum you should have one, and you should print yourself a copy of the <i>GM Sheet</i>. Gather up some index cards or other scrap paper, and provide enough pencils and dice for everyone to have their own set while you play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing online, make sure all of your players have ac- cess to all the materials and let them know which playbooks they should consider. You also want to make sure you’ve got every- one on the same page with whatever video or audio call system you’re using and however you plan on rolling dice!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You also want to take the time to read most of this book! You can probably skim <span class="s20">Chapter 6: Playbooks </span>and <span class="s20">Chapter 7: Ad- vancement</span>. You definitely need to read <span class="s20">Chapter 3: Fundamen- tals of Play </span>and <span class="s20">Chapter 8: Running the Game </span>carefully; both sections contain what you need to know to run the game well.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Selecting an Era and Setting Tone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part45.htm#bookmark90" class="s22">It’s usually a good idea to select an era (page 108)</a> and scope with your players before you start playing. You can decide to choose an era when you get together, but everyone benefits from having some background for the choices you make when you start.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You might even suggest an era to your group that you feel comfortable with as a GM. <span class="s20">Chapter 2: The World of Avatar </span>provides everything you need to know about each era—includ- ing significant themes for each—but it’s totally okay to say you want to focus on an era or two that you’re most familiar with, or that you think best fits the kind of game you want to run. For example, you may prefer the Hundred Year War Era because it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">feels most like the original run of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and that’s the show you know the best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whatever era your group picks, review the era section in <span class="s20">Chap- ter 2: The World of Avatar </span>and note the significant themes and adventure hooks—that’s why it’s useful to choose in advance of the first session, so you have time to look over the setting. When you review your chosen era in this book, take some notes on what you think is most interesting so you can talk about it during your first session! Discuss with your group the major themes you want to feature, and collectively agree about what kind of tone you want the game to have. Is it a light-hearted romp in the Kyoshi Era, filled with lawless adventure? Or is it a serious exploration of the challenges of governance set after <i>The Legend of Korra</i>? Any era can hit multiple tones, so make sure everyone is on the same page about what your campaign will feel like!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Starting the First Session</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone is ready to play—but before anyone makes a character—start by completing the <i>Campaign Creation Work- sheet</i>
<a href="part46.htm#bookmark91" class="s22">: select the scope and a group focus and detail the inciting incident. You can read more about choosing the group’s scope and focus on page 109,</a> but your primary job as GM is to facili- tate the group’s discussion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can still participate in the discussion, and in some cases, you might even come to the table with a pre-selected scope and focus—this is your game, too, and you should be excited to play in that world. But most importantly, the players must be invested and interested in the answers they give, so they can make excit- ing characters and portray them to the hilt!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Making Characters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the group has decided on the focus and inciting incident, it’s time to make characters. Introduce each playbook and give a brief overview of each, focusing on the main issues and tensions that type of character brings to the game. Answer any questions that come up, and make suggestions to players struggling to pick a playbook. Make it clear that choosing a playbook is much more about the character’s arc in the story than any particular ability, training, or technique!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remind your players to pay close attention to each feature and their balance track; both playbook elements are a huge part of the experience of playing <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Generally, each playbook is keyed to one or two stats, starting with higher values in those stats than any others, so also point</p>
