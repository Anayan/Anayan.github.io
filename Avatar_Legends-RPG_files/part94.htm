<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There are lots of tabletop RPGs out there, and each one requires unique expertise and skills. No two RPGs are entirely alike, and while some skills from one RPG may overlap with those required by an- other, you should always pay close attention to the specific needs of the RPG you’re playing or running today instead of assuming it works like the one you played or ran yesterday. So as you read this section, you may pick up on interesting ideas or techniques that can help you out with other RPGs…but ev- erything here is first and foremost geared toward</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What honesty demands</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, say what honesty demands—never lie to the other players. You are their only lens into the fiction—you don’t have to tell them every single thing that’s true, but you can’t tell them anything untrue to preserve surprises. Phrases like “you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">think,” “you believe,” or “you can’t tell” are very helpful here. For instance, if asked who’s in the gallery and you know an assassin lurks in the statuary, don’t say, “No one.” You might say some- thing like, “You think you’re alone, but it’s dark and there are plenty of shadows around,” or you might call for a PC to <span class="s8">assess the situation </span>or even <span class="s8">push their luck </span>to search the area. Lying to your players or misleading them only makes it harder for them to get on the same page with you and to trust you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, stick to the truths you’ve established. If you decid- ed before the session that the kidnapped princess is in the Spirit World, don’t change your mind and plop her in the theatre just because the PCs went there first. Follow your fiction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But even as you stick to established truths, you can expand, elaborate, or manipulate those truths. While you shouldn’t ignore truths you’ve established, it’s perfectly fine to add new facts that make the game more fun. If you decide that a spirit can “only” be defeated by saltwater, but the companions steal a scroll that contains a special ritual others believe will appease the spirit…don’t have the scroll turn out to be a dud. The ritual works, in some fashion. After all, the ritual need not “defeat” the spirit. Or maybe it does, by creating a salty rainstorm effect in the area. Either way, you as GM have accepted a new truth, but stayed honest by sticking to what you had planned. On top of that, you’ve rewarded players for playing the game and seizing new opportunities!</p>
