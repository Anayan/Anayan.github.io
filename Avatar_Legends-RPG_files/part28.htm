<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nobility &amp; the Guiding Wind</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Some may find the idea of the Guiding Wind ac- cepting Fire Nation, Earth Kingdom, or even Water Tribe nobility into their ranks perplexing. What’s im- portant to remember is the young nobles who join the Guiding Wind are rebels just like the movement. They’re the ultimate fist in the face to the ideal of nobility, because these youths gave up their wealth and power for enlightenment, whereas the nobles supporting the Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning did not. Khandro gladly welcomes any nobles into his order who adhere to its ideals.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Guiding Wind, led by Monk Khandro, is a renegade order of Air Nomads, not officially recognized by any of the four temples. The Eastern Air Temple views them as too disruptive, the North as too extreme, and the West as too in opposition to tradition. The South has yet to take an official stance. Khandro happily criticizes every temple, believing every Council of Elders lazy at best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One element that worries Khandro about his movement is the string of violent acts supposedly perpetrated by members of his order in the Fire Nation. Violent acts aren’t in line with the Guiding Wind’s principles, let alone those of the Air Nomads as a whole. Khandro can’t trace the reports to any known members. He is left to wonder—if the Air Nomads aren’t perpetrating violence in the name of the Guiding Wind…who would do such a thing and why? Maybe the Fire Lord’s supporters have an idea.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Working together with Avatar Roku, the Air Nomads are spread across the world helping to keep peace in the various nations. They’re diplomats, spiritual advisors, and even martial defenders when needed. Most Air Nomads don’t have time to engage in the philosophical discussions on the nature of their order that the Council of Elders and various Air Nomad philosophers do—they’re out in the world doing things, instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many Airbenders recognize they’re starting to be worn thin. While they have enough Air Nomads to fulfill their duties for now, the temples can sometimes be near-empty as members rush out to deal with one disaster or the next. The idea that any- one would mount a full-scale attack on the peaceful Air Nomads is inconceivable…and yet some Air Nomads have become aware that if an all-out attack came, they would have trouble mustering enough strength in one place to stop the attackers.</p>

</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Roku Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes are reexamining their role in the world, strug- gling to find a path true to their traditions as the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom rapidly expand their reach—all while the spirits in the polar regions grow agitated and aggressive. Many suspect that these changes within the Spirit World are because of the rapid industrialization happening all over the world and seek to quell the spirits before it is too late.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many tribespeople also now believe the tribes should look outward, traveling to the other nations more frequently to trade with allies or even attempting to gain control of important ship- ping routes; others seek to follow the model of the Air Nomads by avoiding direct conflict in favor of living in harmony on traditional lands. Yet, no one in the tribes can deny the world is changing around them—both Southern chieftain Qanitt and Northern chief Skiri propose new ideas for the future of the tribes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Qanitt is a popular Southern chieftain who wants to secure political ties through peaceful means and cooperation. They see the signs of the spirits’ agitation and believe it’s important to gain allies as soon as possible. They want to open up stronger relationships with other nations, especially taking advantage of the tribes’ resources and crafts to create trade connections with the others. In contrast, Skiri believes other nations have taken enough from the tribes. Foreigners patrol the waters with aban- don and ignore the outcry from the spirits. The Northern chief believes the tribes should meet the other nations on their own terms—aggression and battle—as it seems the only way to get the other nations to listen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Despite the disagreements between the North and South,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">communication between the two is open and fruitful. Though on opposite sides of the world, both work with one another for mutu- al benefit. They’ve so far been willing to put any internal disagree- ment aside to present a united front on the international stage.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qanitt</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Southern Water Tribe chieftain looking to grow the economy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qanitt is the cool-headed chieftain of the prominent city of Whale Harbor in the Southern Water Tribe. They’re a modernist who looks to facilitate the two tribes working in harmony, joining together on political and economic programs that benefit both.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They’ve made several trips to the North to try to establish plans for economic expansion—they’re convinced the two Tribes can only stand against the agitated spirits and the encroaching reach of the other nations together. But Qanitt acknowledges a need for a secure source of resources, such as ore and trading partners, to do so. To that end the chieftain searches for heroes who can help them peacefully secure these resources, either by forging new shipping routes or opening up new agreements between the tribes and trading partners. In return Qanitt offers support to allies who’ve proven their loyalty, and as a person with significant popularity in the South, this is valuable indeed.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Skiri</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Northern Water Tribe chief who wants to seize power for the Tribes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Skiri is the forceful chief of the Northern Water Tribe. He is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22">convinced that the Tribes should engage the conflicts of the day, seizing control of trade routes and imposing fees on those Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom ships traveling via open water. He isn’t against Qanitt’s proposals for more cooperation, but he believes the Tribes need to aggressively protect what is theirs before seeking more international cooperation. His proposals are controversial, and he has resorted to blackmail and threats to advance his cause. He pushed the hardest for at- tacking the Earth Kingdom after the earthquake (page </a>46), but cooler heads prevailed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though a popular leader at home, Skiri has lost international allies by often speaking out against the Earth King, who many see as harmless. Skiri is willing to pay good money to any person who can get him intel on the Earth Kingdom’s movements and plans.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Makittuq</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A powerful Waterbender with a deep connection to spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Makittuq is a tall woman with a broad, warm smile. A powerful bender of the Northern Water Tribe, Makittuq has always felt isolated from others, more in touch with the spirits than people. From a young age she knew she was assigned the wrong gender at birth; when her family rejected her need to live openly as her true identity, she found solace in interacting with spirits who understood her true self. As the spirits have become agitated, Makittuq has taken it upon herself to develop her rare water- bending ability to calm spirits thrown out of balance. She lives near the edge of a large spirit forest and does her best to keep Dark Spirits from attacking Agna Qel’a and other settlements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">She’s happy for assistance from heroes also looking for ways</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to maintain balance with the spirits and will teach any worthy Waterbender how to heal others regardless of their gender.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tiqriganiannig</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A wealthy merchant looking to expand her reach</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tiqriganiannig (or Tiq), the richest person in the South, made her fortune shipping Southern textiles and art throughout the Earth Kingdom. She avidly supports Qanitt’s efforts to expand the Tribe’s economic reach, proudly reminding anyone who listens that her imports regularly inspire the newest fashion trends in the Earth Kingdom. Tiq isn’t shy about throwing her money around either. She’s even financially supporting “freedom fighters” in the Earth Kingdom who hope to unseat Earth King Jialun. After all, taxes on her shipments could be a lot lower with someone else in charge!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Heroes could run into Tiq anywhere her ships carry goods. Happy to rope anyone competent into her employ, she is cur- rently looking for people to help guard the Grand Tour of the <i>Unity </i>

</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Roku’s waterbending master</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taqukaq is the Northern waterbending master who taught Avatar Roku waterbending. He initially refused to train Roku, believing that any Fire Nation subject would hold a higher loyalty to the Fire Lord than the people of the Four Nations. However, Roku refused to seek another instructor and eventual- ly convinced Taqukaq of his devotion by living in the North for several years.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Waterbender is a kind, soft-spoken man with an innate charisma and force of personality. He uses these gifts to perform diplomatic missions for the Water Tribes…along with a bit of covert espionage along the way. He spends his time between the Fire Nation and Northern Water Tribe investigating allegations that the Fire Nation has stolen Tribe technology. Taqukaq is wary of any person willing to selflessly help him with his mission, but accepts help from those who prove their motivations earnest.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Massak</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A master boatwright wary of the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part27.htm#bookmark46" class="s22">Massak is a master boatwright of the Southern Water Tribe. Her work with Nyn Chei (page 49)</a> was pivotal in the develop- ment of the Fire Nation’s fleet, but Massak saw her design was used to create a defensive patrol ship, rather than a trade ship that could swiftly reach the Water Tribes as promised. Nyn and Massak have not spoken for years, and Massak now regrets the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aid she provided her former lover and design partner—although she still misses Nyn dearly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22">Currently, Massak is being courted by Earth Kingdom recruiters, looking to have her as a guest lecturer in Ba Sing Se’s Royal Learning Hall. Despite her suspicions after hearing ru- mors of what happened to the Earth Sages (page 46),</a> Massak is considering the offer; her insatiable curiosity might still get the best of her. Perhaps by accepting the position, she can un- ravel whatever scheme the Earth Kingdom has cooked up. She’s currently looking for allies willing to join her in digging deeper into the Earth King’s secrets…</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This halfway point between the Water Tribes, off the coast of the Earth Kingdom, has spiritual and cultural significance to both the North and South. For thousands of years any severe disputes between the two Tribes were brought to this island, and chiefs make a voyage to the island at least once in their careers to pay respect to the land.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On one such voyage, a Southern chieftain by the name of Tana was surprised to find Fire Nation ships docked on the island. Through political channels Northern chief Skiri learned the Fire Nation now claims the island as their own. Skiri is ready to send a majority of his fleet to reclaim the island, but needs support from the Southern chieftains. So far the chieftains hav- en’t come to a consensus on what to do as many are unwilling to start an all-out war with the Fire Nation.</p>

<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22">The waters between the Northern Water Tribe and the Earth Kingdom contain valuable fishing grounds and waterways leading into both the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation. The Northern Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom have been embroiled in a conflict for control of the waterways, which came to a head after a devastating tsunami (page 46).</a> After Avatar Roku stepped in and Air Nomads arrived to help keep the peace, the conflict quieted for a time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">However, the governor of Chenbao has demanded taxes on Water Tribe merchant ships who use the northern passage, though there is no practical way to enforce this. The merchant</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ships have avoided the taxes with their sailing mastery, but any goods they sell in the Earth Kingdom are now contraband—and the governor hopes this move escalates the situation, as he peti- tions the Earth King for military assistance enforcing his tax.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bands of dark spirits now rage through the wilderness in both the North and South. Some remote villages have been attacked by these spirits, hurting people and damaging homes. Members of both tribes are worried, because though they’ve kept the spirits appeased for now, it is only a matter of time before the situation becomes untenable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most spiritually-focused tribespeople feel not only a deep sense of duty to the spirits, but to the rest of the world to ensure things remain peaceful for everyone. Some scholars and spiritual leaders believe this increase of spiritual activity is linked to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the various nations extending their reach and abusing natural resources for technological advancement. With the Fire Nation laying claim to Water Tribe sacred land and hunting dragons, and the Earth Kingdom displacing spirits in their search for nat- ural resources, no wonder the spirits in the world are in chaos.</p>

<a href="part22.htm#bookmark36" class="s22">In this era, the 55 Earth Kingdom states have become increasingly isolationist. In the previous era, Avatar Kyoshi (page 32)</a>
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22"> helped shape various bureaucratic policies in order to aid the poorest of the kingdom and strengthen ties between states. These policies carried through to this era and were embraced by the Earth Sages. After seeing their order embarrassed and diminished in past years, the sages sought redemption by getting the states to work with one another, embracing their role as wise advisors and academics. This laid the groundwork for the sages regaining much of the trust they lost. They even dared speak out against the Earth King when they felt his actions became too brazen. Then, in one night, the Earth Sage order was eliminated (page 46).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Ever since the order’s destruction, the current Earth King</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">has manipulated the constitution, set up by Kyoshi and the 46<span class="s45">th </span>Earth King, into a bloated piece of legislation, which only the rich know how to exploit. Earth King Jialun is a cruel man who cares very little for his people and very much about maintain- ing power. He is willing to take extreme measures to ensure his uncontested rule and foments xenophobic hate for other nations and internal squabbling to avoid losing power—thus the peas- ants have something to hate other than him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Thanks to Jialun’s greed, people in the kingdom suffer. Mean- while, governors of the various states rule near-autonomously; even the most noble governors face an uphill battle combatting the corruption their more nefarious counterparts gleefully em- brace. There’s little in the form of broad technological advance- ment in the Earth Kingdom at this time, not because there aren’t scholars working on it, but because any new technology is seized by the crown and gifted out to vassals as the Earth King sees fit.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Jialun is a petty, calculating man continuously underestimat-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">ed because of the bureaucratic nature of the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To outsiders he’s a ruler trapped in the binds of an ineffective system which fails to empower people, but Jialun knows he’s the spider spinning the web. After he did away with the sages, he manipulated the system to his benefit and the incompetence he portrays is entirely by design. He keeps his people subjugated and ruthlessly removes any opposition to his rule, all from an ap- pearance of weakness. Internationally, he manipulates others to keep the people in the Earth Kingdom focused on threats from outside rather than within.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Jialun is likely to contact heroes if they have something he wants or something he can exploit. If they cause enough trouble, they’re likely to encounter the Dai Li first, and Jialun second only if they cannot be contained. The Earth King is never one</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to overplay his hand and always approaches as a friend first to entrap a person in his schemes.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guo Xun</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The benevolent queen of Omashu who works to undermine Jialun’s rule <span class="p">Guo Xun is the graceful and elderly queen of Omashu. As a child, she idolized Kyoshi, who supported Guo Xun’s family tak- ing the throne with the sacred duty to protect Omashu. When she became queen, she wholeheartedly embraced the political structure the Avatar helped create. She despises Jialun, finding most of his actions cheap and selfish; only someone insecure</span>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in their power needs to weaken the standing of those who have nothing to begin with. So, she works as a balancing force to Jial- un’s machinations, embroiling her city and its diplomats in just enough conflict to not spark an all-out war with Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Guo Xun is likely to contact heroes if they’re notably op- posed to Jialun’s schemes in the Earth Kingdom. She might ask them to spy for her or smuggle technologies for her scholars undetected in the Earth Kingdom. She’s a brilliant political strat- egist and can help sharpen the keenest minds.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sud</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The earthbending master who taught the Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sud is a middle-aged earthbending master with a blunt and straightforward attitude. The Earthbender is famed throughout the kingdom for his honesty and grit. There’s no stronger believ- er in the Earth Kingdom and what it represents than Sud, who is convinced Earth Kingdom citizens can hammer out the issues with their great nation and see a brighter future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Earthbender was recently summoned to instruct Earth King Jialun in advanced earthbending techniques, after Sud’s success with teaching Roku. Through the months Sud’s spent at the palace he’s noticed Jialun is not so ignorant as he pretends to be. Sud’s worried the king has nefarious plans for the kingdom, but the earthbending master is in over his head when it comes to politics. He may need a hero’s help to unravel the schemes the Earth King has put in place.</p>

<a name="bookmark52">Grand Lector Willow</a>
</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A former Earth Sage working to preserve knowledge of her extinct order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">When the Earth Sage order was abolished, Willow received two</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">choices—evolve or disappear forever. Rather than perish with her order, she accepted a new position teaching in the rebranded</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Royal Learning Halls and vowed to never speak of her order again. Those who still fondly remember the sages see the flighty lector Willow as a traitor, someone who betrayed her colleagues for a prestigious new position, but Willow is not entirely as she seems.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Within the soft-spoken lector burns a fire of rebellion. She is furious about what happened to her fellow sages and the knowledge they worked to protect. From her position in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Royal Learning Halls, she works to preserve ancient Earth Sage knowledge for a time when her destroyed order may be resur- rected. Currently, she’s in search of allies who can help her do this, to smuggle ancient scrolls to safe locations and perhaps to uncover what happened to her missing colleagues.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ban Buhai</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A spy who poses as a lowly fish merchant</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buhai is an unremarkable fish merchant who often takes his stock to sell in Ba Sing Se…but really, Buhai is a spy for the Earth King who uses his fishing business as an excuse to be away for long periods of time spying on the Northern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He’s extremely good at his job and even the name Buhai is an alias—to those who know the truth of him, he’s only referred to as Echo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The spy’s current mission is to discover a way to destabilize the Water Tribes’ alliance with one another. The Earth King believes that if he can get the North to act unilaterally without an agreement with the South, it would drive a wedge between the tribes. To that end, Buhai gathers intel on the North’s chief to exploit at a later time.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Langzi</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A notorious outlaw folk hero looking to stamp out corruption</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Langzi is a wandering outlaw with a penchant for doling out justice. People say they’re a master warrior who can wield almost any weapon. No one knows who they are or what they look like, as they always keep their face covered in a mask, but their focus is on taking down corrupt politicians who exploit the common folk. They’re currently at the top of the Dai Li’s most wanted list.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In truth, Langzi was a swordsmith named Junyi who fell in love with one of his clients. The two men were set to run away together when his lover’s wife, who was mayor of the town, discovered the affair. She had her husband killed and pinned the crime on Junyi, manipulating the system so he had no way to prove his innocence. Since then, Junyi has been on the run, posing as a lowly beggar in various towns to uncover corrupt people in power and bring them to justice under the identity of Langzi. Junyi never seeks out allies, but could potentially work with people who align with his goals.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Resources and Industrialization</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22">Natsuo Island lies just between the Fire Nation and Earth King- dom just off the coast of Crescent Island. Because of its proxim- ity to both nations, both governments never laid claim to it… until now, following the discovery of a large cache of ore on the island. Sozin claims the island is part of the Fire Nation and that the citizens of the Fire Nation need the island after the Crescent Island disaster (page 46).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Earth King knows Sozin’s posturing serves his nation’s growing industry, not his people, and isn’t willing to let the Fire Nation have the island without opposition. If Jialun goads Sozin into making the first move towards aggression, even better. To that end he’s sent a few military vessels on training exercises just off the island’s coast and waits to see Sozin’s next move.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se vs. Omashu</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Propaganda and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Omashu and Ba Sing Se have often vied for prominence within the Earth Kingdom and this era is no different. Guo Xun, the queen of Omashu, hates the Earth King and does everything in her power to undermine his influence short of starting an all-out war. Both monarchs have numerous spies in each other’s courts and both throne rooms are vipers’ nests.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Recently, the delivery system in Omashu, long chutes weaving through the city navigated with earthbending, has been acting up. Lines are crumbling and wares fly from the chutes and injure citizens. Guo Xun is sure this is Jialun’s sabotage and she’s looking for a way to prove it. She needs the saboteur caught and enough</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evidence to utterly humiliate Jialun next time she visits Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Floods in the South</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Connection vs. Isolation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The south of the Earth Kingdom faces a number of floods, which have devastated small towns and infrastructure. Rather than sending aid to these remote villages, the Earth King has sent troops offering the citizens affected by these floods a home in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se’s Lower Ring in return for work fortifying the Outer Wall. With some towns experiencing a near-leveling of their infrastructure, many consider it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In contrast, some accepted the aid from the Air Nomads of the Southern Air Temple. Though the Air Nomads of the south have been hesitant to overstep their bounds in Earth Kingdom land, they’re more than willing to help when natural disaster strikes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some Earth Kingdom citizens question if it is wise to reject the king’s generous offer in lieu of asking the Air Nomads’ help, but surely the king is too magnanimous to truly take offense.</p>
