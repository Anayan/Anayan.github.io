<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">In many tabletop roleplaying games, characters become stronger and more straightforwardly powerful over the course of the campaign. That’s true to some extent of <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>as well—PCs earn growth, which eventually becomes advancements that improve the character. So it can be easy for everyone in the game to focus on accumulating growth as the primary form of advancement in the whole campaign. But growth is just one method of “advancement,” and the others are just as crucial—both players and GMs should keep these other forms of advancement in mind!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">PCs grow in their trainings by acquiring new techniques, first and foremost. The best way to easily differentiate between a novice Firebender and a trained master is by how many and which techniques they have. PCs can find new masters to teach them techniques—often, a PC will identify a technique that a foe just used against them, and then set out to learn that technique, perhaps even from that very foe! Both players and the GM should keep an eye out for opportunities for the PCs to learn new tech- niques, especially because fulfilling mastery conditions</p>

<a href="part85.htm#bookmark166" class="s25">is one of the best ways for PCs to be faced with hard lessons (see page 214</a> for more on mastery conditions).</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The way the PCs struggle with their balance principles is another kind of development and advancement. As a PC pushes their center ever closer to one principle, they both become stronger in some respects—better able to <span class="s66">live up to their principle</span>—and closer to losing their balance! And at some point, a PC will resolve the tension between their principles, genuinely choosing one over the other. That kind of advancement can lead a PC to changing playbooks entirely, or even retiring from play!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">As you play <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, be sure to keep these other forms of advancement in mind—and read more about them in <b>Chapter 7: Advancement</b>!</p>

<a href="part82.htm#bookmark162" class="s22">Growth questions point at core lessons the PCs can learn about themselves and the world, pushing them to be open-minded he- roes. The core three questions can be answered collectively as a group, while each PC’s individual playbook question is answered individually. For more on growth questions, see page 209.</a>

<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you spend time with a teacher learning and training in a new technique, roll with modifiers from the following questions:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of conditions? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Do you and your teacher share at least one background? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training and learning? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, and skills? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a hit, you learn the technique, and your master shifts your balance. On a 10+, you learn it with ease, and it takes as little time as possible. On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark two conditions. On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need another lesson before you can grasp its full use. Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, and you learn the technique.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The training move is all about acquiring new techniques by studying with a master. It almost always requires you to have a teacher, and it requires you to have the appropriate training to learn the technique. For more on the training move, see page</p>
