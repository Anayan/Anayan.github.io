Keep them in mind to help shape the scenes you play out with the other players. The guidelines are:</p>

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Describe a wondrous world with a deep history <span class="p">Take time to describe small details about the world: what uni- form does the staff wear at this particular Republic City hotel? What story do the intricate murals on the walls of the Air Tem- ple depict? What are the dominant scents of the tea that’s just been served? Don’t overdo it with these details, but a few each scene makes the world feel richer and more alive.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember the word “wondrous.” Lace your descriptions with things that spark curiosity and awe. The world is filled with ancient spirits, rich cultures, and deep history. What do the clothes or food you described have to do with the culture that produced them? What detail about the surroundings or build- ings betray an ancient, fantastical story?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s okay if you’re not an expert on the lore of the Avatarverse!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It’s more important to create a sense of a history for players to hook into, than <i>the </i>history. Place that history throughout your story, and it will bring your game to life!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Address the characters, not your players</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To help the other players get into character and think like their PCs, default to addressing the characters and not the players. When talking to Hector about his character Haki, say, “Haki, what do you do next?” instead of “Hector, what does Haki do next?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Of course, there are definitely situations where you speak to the players directly. When you have issues regarding safety tools, for instance, it’s a good idea to pause play and speak to the play- ers (not their characters) about how the table should proceed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But addressing the characters puts the PC at the forefront of the player’s mind. It’s good to say something like, “Haki, do you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">recognize Avatar Roku, standing in front of you? Or do you just see a man in Fire Nation robes with long white hair and a distinctive headpiece?” That way, you wind up both drawing in player knowl- edge—the player knows this is Avatar Roku, even if the character doesn’t—while emphasizing the character and their point of view.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Be the companions’ biggest fan</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Look for opportunities to highlight the companions’ unique qual- ities—their cool moves, backgrounds, and training. Give Water- benders water to use; give the Successor plenty of chances to face or interact with their family. Make sure every PC gets to have their moment in the spotlight! Similarly, make sure each player gets to speak and each PC gets to act for roughly similar amounts of time, especially if the team has split up. Remember to allow a PC to make at least one move or major decision before shifting the spotlight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes, this means foregoing a dice roll. If a companion’s background, history, or training removes the uncertainty factor in a situation, no moves trigger (and as a result no roll is needed). The Hammer with a Military background might be able to win a junior soldier’s cooperation without <span class="s8">pleading</span>, for example. There</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is no uncertainty in the fact that a junior soldier would respect the Hammer’s military past, and they would simply cooperate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Other times, being a fan means making the PCs’ lives a bit harder. After all, when you’re a fan of a character, you want to see them face challenges; you don’t just want to see them win all the time. Powerful opponents, dangerous situations, difficult</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">decisions—all of these give the characters a chance to shine, too.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ask questions and let your players answer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In your role as GM you don’t need all the answers. In fact, play- ers feel more involved when you turn to them to fill in gaps in the world from time to time. This technique is especially power- ful if you tie it to the PCs’ stories. When you’re at a loss for what to say in the story or feel the scene could benefit from additional player investment, ask the players a question that gives them a chance to build the world alongside you.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Order #33482721)</p>

</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For instance, ask the PC with a Military background what marks the Fire Nation captain’s rank and follow up by asking them when they first met a Fire Nation captain. If a certain PC has described a fondness for food, ask them what the Earth Queen serves at the banquet and what memories the food triggers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Use directed questions to help propel the story forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asking the military PC “who was the harshest commander you had?” is more direct and stronger than “did you have a harsh commander?” That said, don’t ever ask questions about things the PC couldn’t know—when a PC looks through a window, don’t ask them what’s inside; instead, ask them how they recog- nize the person sitting at the table!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Put emotions on characters’ sleeves</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories, characters’ emotional and intellectual journeys are important. NPCs might sometimes keep secrets, but they’re always great at betraying how they feel—portray their emotions bubbling and seething, not truly hidden at all, even when they’re trying to hide some other truth. Encourage players to do the same, to roleplay the conditions that affect the companions, to take actions based on where they currently lie on their balance track.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, when a PC has a powerful, dangerous fight with their own parent, ask them at the end what they feel, what’s going through their mind, and how it shows. If the Hammer then says, “I’m so angry I just start throwing rocks around!” that’s perfect—maybe a golden opportunity for an NPC to shift the Hammer’s balance toward Force, or even to have them break something important and clear Angry.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Balance and conditions aren’t the only emotions, though: when an especially intense event occurs, take a moment to ask players what their PCs feel. Not only will this technique help deepen characters and their relationships with each other, answers may even trigger certain moves (especially those regarding balance).</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Resolve conflicts episodically</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many of the other guidelines and ideas push you toward creating ongoing conflicts that flow into surprising new directions…but sometimes you need to wrap things up and move forward. This is not a game served by foes who cannot truly be defeated, or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">by situations too complicated they can never be resolved. Let the PCs be victorious, and let characters or plotlines that have served their purpose fall by the wayside.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, after being taken out in a fight, a minor or even major foe might be truly defeated and captured—the PCs shouldn’t have to spend lots of time arguing with local authori-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ties about how and where and whether to imprison them. If the foe is the greatest antagonist of the entire campaign, defined by their political and criminal influence, then maybe that kind of conflict is perfect…but don’t hesitate to let foes of less impor- tance or power be dealt with, completely and even off-screen to some extent. Similarly, if the PCs incur the wrath of local author- ities when dealing with a foe, then all might be forgiven once they prove that foe’s crimes—the PCs shouldn’t have to remain on the run if that conflict is no longer interesting or serving a purpose in the overall story (besides complicating their lives).</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s21">Remember the history of the world and characters </span>The Avatarverse is filled with history and lore. Draw on <span class="s20">Chapter 2: The World of Avatar </span>or your knowledge of <i>Avatar Legends </i>to bring that lore into your story, but even if you’re not an expert on the world, never fear: you can make it up! Are the companions trekking through an old forest? Maybe it’s the site of an age-old battle! Pepper the woods with ancient weapons, crumbling skeletons, or a cairn, and figure out later what the battle was all about.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Another powerful tool in a GM’s arsenal is reincorporation, taking something that happened before and putting it back into the story. Take notes about what the players do, who they met, and what forces they put into motion. Then, bring these into play in future sessions. Make it clear to the players that <i>their </i>decisions landed their PCs where they are today. The NPC that the compan- ions made friends with might be related to another one they fight or betray; saving a town from a rampaging spirit might draw the attention of a group of rebels seeking a base of operations.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Emphasize lessons throughout</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game <span class="p">shines when players deal with coming-of-age stories. Their stories should be about characters growing, learning, and changing to discover who they are and what they believe in. The PCs take lessons from each other, from the world, and from the NPCs around them with equal frequency.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One way to represent growth and change is through PC balance tracks. Use conflicts and adventure hooks to allow characters to see where they stand on their balance track: use a PC’s interactions with NPCs as opportunities to adjust their current balance. NPCs can even explicitly take on the role of teachers; many of them want to teach the companions lessons and shape how the PCs see the world. They can offer training in new techniques—a kind of lesson that most PCs are interested in—alongside their own beliefs and ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Don’t forget the end-of-session growth questions. Use them to discuss what the companions learned about the world, them- selves and each other. And later, try to reincorporate, counter, or challenge old lessons based on what the players told you.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Give NPCs drives, fears, and hopes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Give all your NPCs realistic motivations and reactions. You don’t need a whole backstory for each NPC, but it helps to consider the things that make them human—in particular, make sure you know what they’re trying to achieve (their <span class="s20">drive</span>
<a href="part97.htm#bookmark188" class="s22">) and flesh it out with their fears and hopes as well. Once a character has this set of moti- vations, you can use them to figure out how an NPC would react to any given situation. You can portray any NPC with just their drive, but having some notion of their fears or hopes helps you bring them to life. The NPCs section (page 234)</a> in this chapter includes more details on building NPCs, including establishing their drive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, say the companions accidentally burn down an old woman’s hut trying to stop a rogue spirit. They unhappily trudge over to report the damage to the old woman where she sells water at the local market. How does she react? If you’ve figured out her drive, you can probably come up with a believ- able (and interesting) reaction—maybe she’s driven by a desire to live in peace, and she reacts with sadness but forgiveness. But if you know she’s also afraid of dangerous warriors, maybe she doesn’t even talk to the PCs anymore—maybe she runs!</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Make conflicts moral choices</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stories shine when choices and goals are morally fraught or when doing the right thing involves unsavory consequences. Conflicts faced by players should make them think about their morals and principles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, the cruel and conniving Princess Azula offers the companions help in taking down a bigger threat, but only in exchange for valuable information that helps Fire Lord Ozai; is the enemy of the enemy your friend (even if temporarily)?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A dilemma like this is a true hard choice, giving the players something to really chew on, but not every problem has to be quite so gray and dramatic. Sometimes it’s enough to have two good people in a long-standing conflict, each with good points about why they are truly right.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, try to get the PCs to make choices that provoke thought about the world and their companions’ place in it, deci- sions that may even shift their balance. NPCs often disagree with the companions, providing opportunities for interesting drama, and some NPCs will act on that disagreement. And a PC might make surprising decisions, wrestling with their demons for a few sessions and ultimately growing through the struggle!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">When thinking of interesting ways to involve moral choices, draw on the themes of your game’s era and on the balance prin- ciples of the companions. These excellent sources of inspiration can pull PCs in different, conflicting directions.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Use imbalance instead of evil</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Avatarverse, true evil is very rare. Even aggressive spirits tend to be either misunderstood, or temporarily out of balance. Humans are even more complex! When portraying antagonists, think about their motivations—drives, fears, and hopes. Make their impulses more about obsessions or taking their methods too far. The bandits don’t just want to hurt people, they need food to survive a cata- strophic drought. The warlord gives out harsh punishments not because she’s evil, but because she’s obsessed with the idea of justice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lean on an NPC’s balance principle to help guide their antagonism. People do bad things when they stray too far from the center and lose their balance, not because of some core evil inside them. Terrible actions are usually self-justified or well-in- tended, but ultimately take balance principles to the extreme. Unbalanced foes act as stark reminders for PCs of what they might become if they commit to their principles too strongly.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Counterbalance darkness with light</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Within all the action, strife, and drama of <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories lie moments of delight and humor—seek out these moments! A lovely night’s rest in a moss-covered forest can be a whole scene; ask the players what their characters do to prepare for the night, what stories they share, what tasty morsels they discover in the wilderness. These moments also provide the perfect opportunities to build bonds between PCs, especially through <span class="s8">guide and comfort</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Introduce genuinely kind, generous, or funny NPCs—not everyone is selfish or unbalanced, driven only by their own needs or philosophy. Thrust the PCs into a fashion show, a dance com- petition, or a family dinner. Show the PCs moments of brightness amid the troubles they have to combat—it’s much easier for play- ers to invest in NPCs or places that show them kindness, humor, or joy. Too much darkness and harsh drama will exhaust players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Keep your players’ boundaries in mind and remind them that they can use their safety tools to tell you if the game’s tone gets too dark (or for that matter, too light). It’s on everyone at the table to make sure there are laughs, even at the darkest times, and real stakes, even when the conflicts might initially seem a little goofy.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Seek consequences besides death</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Death in the Avatarverse is always dramatic and important. PCs never die unless their players choose to let them do so. NPCs shouldn’t die unless their deaths contribute to the story; the companions should never become wanton killers. If an NPC dies, there’s always <i>someone </i>who’s sad.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Think of other ways characters can be defeated—they might fall unconscious, give in to exhaustion, faint from fright. They might</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be captured, humiliated into submission, or become overwhelmed with emotion. A character defeated in an important duel might be universally scorned, banished, or forever lose their self-confidence. In rare circumstances, they might even be taken into the Spirit World, lose their bending, or encounter a more supernatural fate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The tone of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is not one of unending despair and deep tragedy. Deaths tend to happen in the background. The risks and consequences the PCs face should be fix- able, preventable, or survivable; the consequences might seem dire, but the real meat of the story is often how the companions grow and learn after losses they thought they could never endure.</p>
