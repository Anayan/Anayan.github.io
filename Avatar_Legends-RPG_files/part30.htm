<a name="bookmark55">The Air Nomad Genocide</a>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 178pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There are no Air Nomads alive during this era, because of the Air Nomad Genocide nearly a century ago. The Air Temples are dam- aged and in some cases left in ruins. The Mechanist and other Earth Kingdom refugees currently live in the Northern Air Temple, but their technology overtakes much of what was originally there. The Fire Nation has removed or destroyed most of the important relics in the other temples, but there are secrets that only the Air Nomads knew. Some of them likely still lie hidden within the temples.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 178pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The way the world remembers the Air Nomads varies from nation to nation. A few Southern Water Tribe members still speak of the Nomads in hushed tones. Isolated from the majority of Fire Nation propaganda, they realize their people now face an eerily similar fate to the Air Nomads. In Ba Sing Se, no one is even allowed to speak of the war, and it is hard to talk about the Air Nomads without speak- ing of their demise. Meanwhile, Fire Nation propaganda has spread lies about the Air Nomads, claiming that they aspired to conquer the world and that therefore the Fire Army’s actions were justified.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 178pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">For now, the Air Nomads are tragically absent from the world, and nowhere is this absence felt more strongly than in the vacant and overgrown Air Temples.</p>

</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hundred Year War Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the Hundred Year War, the Northern and Southern Wa- ter Tribes are isolated and not communicating with one another. Since the tribes reside at either pole, the distance is too great to cross with the Fire Navy roaming the seas. Some Southerners, however, still feel that the Northern Water Tribe has abandoned their sister tribe to a terrible fate. While the Northern Water Tribe has successfully defended themselves against the Fire Nation’s attacks to the point where they are essentially left alone, the Southern Water Tribe isn’t nearly as lucky.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation’s Southern Raiders wreaked havoc on the villages of the South Pole, imprisoning or killing every Wa- terbender they could find. With the warriors of the Southern Water Tribe off fighting the Fire Nation throughout the world, the survivors in the South are all but defenseless. The Southern Water Tribe as a whole faces near cultural extinction; it’s up to the children and elderly to keep the tribe going.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Chief Arnook is the leader of the Northern Water Tribe, while the Southern Water Tribe is split into several small villag- es. Chieftain Hakoda leads one of those villages, though he is now absent as he leads attacks against the Fire Nation’s military forces. Both of these leaders are pillars of their communities, and many look to them to understand how they should feel about and approach the war.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Arnook</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The composed and friendly leader of the Northern Water Tribe <a href="part15.htm#bookmark27" class="s22">Arnook is the Chief of the Northern Water Tribe and a warrior. He is a capable leader and skilled warrior who follows the tradi- tions of his people. Along with leading the tribe, he carries the knowledge that his daughter, Princess Yue, will one day become the Moon Spirit, Tui (page 21).</a>
<span class="p"> When Yue was born, she became very ill and her parents visited Tui and La in the Spirit Oasis for help. Tui healed her, but later Arnook had a vision of Yue’s ultimate fate. While giving up one’s mortal life to save the Moon Spirit is a tremendous honor, the knowledge haunts him.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Arnook keeps a wary eye on the Fire Nation, but knows Agna Qel’a is well defended from the rest of the world. Though he wishes for the two Water Tribes to unite, his desire to protect his people from the Fire Navy means he keeps his forces close to home. Ar- nook could be willing to help a hero who asked for his aid, if it did not threaten the safety of the Northern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pakku</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A curmudgeon waterbending teacher set in his ways</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part20.htm#bookmark34" class="s22">Pakku is an elderly waterbending teacher who lives with the Northern Water Tribe and a secret member of the White Lotus (page 30).</a> A harsh and irritable instructor, he is skilled at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">what he does and tremendously proud of the Northern Water Tribe. Pakku is adamant that women should learn waterbending for healing and men should learn waterbending for combat, as that is how it has always been done.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Because Pakku is from an older generation, he remembers when the Southern and Northern Water Tribes weren’t cut off from each other. People looking for information about the tribes during the earlier part of the war may come looking for Pakku for answers, but he won’t give them up easily. Anyone who needs a favor from the teacher must earn his respect first.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yagoda</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A kind healing arts teacher who has a way with children</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yagoda is a healing master from the Northern Water Tribe. She has a special gift for instructing the very young as she is kind and fairly laid back. Since the Northern Water Tribe has strict rules about only men being allowed to learn waterbending to fight and only women learning waterbending to heal, Yagoda must abide by those rules when taking on students.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Anyone who suffers an injury while in Agna Qel’a is likely to be tended to by one of Yagoda’s former students or perhaps</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yagoda herself if the injury is bad enough. Those in search of the best possible healing teacher might seek her out for instruction, but if they aren’t a woman, they might want to look for one of her more open-minded students instead.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A loving father and chieftain fighting the war far from home</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hakoda is a Southern Water Tribe chieftain and father to a young Waterbender named Katara and a young warrior named Sokka. He is a kindhearted person who understands what it’s like to feel helpless against the Fire Nation, as he lost his wife, Kya, to Fire Nation raiders. As part of a small fleet currently targeting vulner- able Fire Navy units, Hakoda puts his life in harm’s way every day in order to protect his tribe and family. Since the Fire Nation has more advanced technology at their disposal, Hakoda’s group of warriors use their superior knowledge of the waters and material mastery to stay ahead of the soldiers. Hakoda and his group are strong allies for those who have faced loss due to the war and are willing to do whatever it takes to bring an end to it.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mamnguqsualuq</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The leader of a secret Southern Water Tribe settlement <span class="p">Mamnguqsualuq is the wily elderly leader of a small Southern Water Tribe settlement that lives in a hidden cave system. Her original home was one of the first to suffer at the hands of the Fire Nation’s raiders, and as a young scout she found a com- plex cave system that went deep into the ice but was still warm</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">enough to live in, with many fish swimming in big pools. Mamn- guqsualuq moved her entire settlement into the caves, and they have lived there ever since.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">No other tribes know about these caves, but they may spot moving apparitions far off in the snow drift. This lends credence to the rumors of dark spirits in that area of the South Pole, and few dare to go near. Mamnguqsualuq cautiously takes in anyone who needs shelter so long as she believes they can be trusted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She’s also one of the most skilled scouts and trackers left in the south with her unparalleled knowledge of the land.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hama</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Bloodbender on the run from the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hama is a waterbending master who was born in the Southern Water Tribe. She survived the Fire Nation’s relentless raids only to be captured and locked away in a prison for Waterbenders. During her years of imprisonment, in a place the Fire Nation specially designed to make waterbending impossible, she real- ized she was more powerful during a full moon and could con- trol the water in bodies. Through years of training manipulating elephant rats she mastered bloodbending and used it to escape.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Hama is twisted from her years of torturous imprisonment and often unable to think clearly when it comes to the Fire Nation and its people, even if they’re innocent of crimes. She’s looking for a safe place to retire, but it seems the Fire Nation is just about everywhere. Hama is a powerful bender and will</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">help fellow Waterbenders, people from the tribes, or those who oppose the Fire Nation.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Raiders harmed the Southern Water Tribe in more ways than one. Since the attacks, the tribe has struggled with cultural decline because so many of the people who kept the tribe’s traditions were killed or captured. They also see the beginnings of an imbalance with the Spirit World, with dark spirits becoming more active due to the decline in spiritual practices. Additionally, members of the Southern Water Tribe must cope with almost no Waterbenders. Many barely have time to grieve the loss of their loved ones, let alone maintain old tradi- tions. Those who want to protect the tribe’s history and heritage have a difficult task, as important cultural knowledge disappears forever with the deaths of its keepers and the theft of important artifacts by the Fire Nation.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Too Young to Fight</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Hope in Rebellion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plenty of young members of both Tribes are eager to become fully fledged warriors, but the world is a dangerous place for the unprepared. The Northern Water Tribe focuses solely on defense, so aspiring warriors who want to do more than stand guard atop ice walls have a hard time finding teachers willing to instruct them, let alone then escaping Agna Qel’a to participate in the wider war. In the Southern Water Tribe, the youngest warriors are tasked with staying home and protecting those the adult warriors left behind. Children and teenagers who want to go help the war effort have a difficult decision to make. Should they even consider leaving their wards behind if it causes hard- ship? Or is joining the fight worth it to protect their people and cultural heritage?</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Island Prison</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Brutality of War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation’s prison located on a remote Fire Island is specially designed to contain Waterbenders by being brutally dry. Prisoners are kept in cages suspended from the ground, and dry air is piped in so that they can’t harness any water in the air. Treatment of the inmates is inhumane, and anyone who steps out of line is severely punished.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Waterbenders who were not killed in the Southern Raids are kept in this prison or others like it, and escape is only a forlorn dream. These Waterbenders are in no shape to fight their way out and Waterbenders breaking in to free prisoners need to bring their own water to fight with. There is one story</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of a Waterbender successfully escaping the prison, even with no water to be seen—the guards who survived talk about “bending sweat” and “bloodbending,” but official Fire Nation policy holds that no one has ever escaped, and that there is no such thing as</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“bloodbending.”</p>

<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hundred Year War Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Kuei, the 52<span class="s45">nd </span>Earth King, currently rules the Earth King- dom from the heart of Ba Sing Se under the corrupt guidance of Grand Secretariat Long Feng. Kuei is completely unaware that a war is even happening as Long Feng has taken extreme</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">measures to keep him in the dark. Kuei may be king in name, but the Grand Secretariat makes all decisions for him. He has even forbidden Earth Kingdom citizens from so much as mentioning the war to maintain the ruse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark54" class="s22">With the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se repaired after Iroh’s siege (page 58),</a> it is as ready to defend against Fire Nation attacks as ever before. Likewise, the mountaintop city of Omashu flourishes as a bastion of resistance against the Fire Nation. Its</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">technologists and crafters supply the bulk of weapons to the rest of the Earth Kingdom resistance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite Omashu’s best efforts, the rest of the Earth Kingdom struggles. The Fire Army has conquered or destroyed many areas, and the Earth Kingdom cannot defend all its territories. Refugees from throughout the kingdom flee to Ba Sing Se in hopes of finding safety there and as a result, the Lower Ring is overcrowded. The quality of life is subpar in this part of the city, and many issues there are ignored by the government.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sadly, being ignored by the government in Ba Sing Se is often the best fate an Earth Kingdom citizen could hope for. Rural government officials and Fire Nation soldiers take advantage of the chaos to harass and extort locals. Some Earth Kingdom sol- diers stationed in small villages steal from their own civilians and threaten anyone who stands up to them. Even within Ba Sing Se, the Dai Li—a secret police force controlled by Long Feng—in- timidates and brainwashes anyone who speaks of the war. Ba Sing Se’s walls may keep civilians safe from the outside, but very little keeps them safe from corrupt forces on the inside.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A scheming politician who controls the crown</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng, the corrupt Grand Secretariat of Ba Sing Se, keeps the Earth King in the dark about the existence of the Hundred Year War. His thirst for power makes him ambitious, and his skill as a manipulator combined with the king’s sheltered life makes it easy for Long Feng to use him as a puppet to further his agenda. In addition to serving as advisor to the king, Long Feng is also the head of the Dai Li. He keeps secret files on people of interest locked away in his office and sometimes intercepts letters to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or from them. While the Dai Li handle most minor incidents (catching someone speaking about the war), people who consis- tently get the Dai Li’s attention or are caught sending a message to the king must face Long Feng directly.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Bumi</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The feisty king of Omashu and master Earthbender</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bumi is the eccentric, elderly king of Omashu. He’s highly skilled at earthbending and though he appears frail, scat-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ter-brained, and whacky with his wry smile and unkempt hair, he is in fact stronger than ever. Under his guidance, Omashu turned from a remote bastion to the main supplier of weapons for the Earth Kingdom resistance. Bumi fosters his most skilled inventors to create practical and effective weaponry and uses his tactical mind to get these supplies all over the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Even with Bumi’s best efforts, the Fire Nation is taking land faster than he can supply it. If a hero can help the King smuggle weapons or foil Fire Nation plans, he’d happily accept their help. He might even teach someone advanced earthbending tech- niques if they truly help the war effort…although that requires them to decipher his lessons through the whispers to himself and the giggling outbursts.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Council of Five</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Five generals who report to a corrupt official</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Council of Five is a group of five Earth Kingdom generals who lead the Earth Kingdom war efforts. Led by General How, the council oversees all things militaristic and also presides over the Royal Earthbender Guards. In addition to How, the other members are the wrathful General Sung, the taciturn General Yiwen, the strict General Khièu, and General Duanmu, who is just about fed up with Long Feng’s machinations. Each of them lives within the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se and they frequently convene at the palace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Historically, this group worked in conjunction with the Earth King as his hand-picked advisors, but during this time they are appointed by Grand Secretariat Long Feng. The Council of Five share all of their plans and information with Long Feng because they believe it is in the best interests of the Earth Kingdom. How- ever, some council members may be willing to keep small secrets from Long Feng if convinced it serves Kuei and the Earth King- dom. Though most Council members fear the Grand Secretariat, many secretly remain loyal to the crown they swore to defend.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Dai Li</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A secret police force with a tight grip on Ba Sing Se</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng controls a secret police force called the Dai Li. Orig- inally created and trained by Avatar Kyoshi much to her later regret, the Dai Li were meant to preserve the Earth Kingdom’s cultural heritage and traditions. Now, they use hypnosis to brain- wash people in the facility hidden underneath Lake Laogai and act as spies for Long Feng.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Dai Li are chosen at a young age and molded into the perfect secret agents, making it difficult, though not impossible, to sway their loyalties. One of the Dai Li’s signature techniques is the use of rock gloves to restrain their opponents and pin them against surfaces. It’s extremely difficult to break free from these restraints for anyone except Earthbenders. Anyone who breaks the illusion that “There is no war in Ba Sing Se” is a potential target for the Dai Li. Likewise, the Dai Li may try to intimidate anyone seen associ- ating with suspected dissidents into acting as informants.</p>
