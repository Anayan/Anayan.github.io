<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playing Outside Your Experience</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The world of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legend of Korra </i>draws influences from a wide variety of Asian and In- digenous cultures. Just like our world, these stories feature heroes of different cultures, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, religions, and abilities. For some players, this might be your first time playing a game in a world where all the characters don’t share your background.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players should explore this world through the eyes of its people, and that might mean playing outside of your own experience. You might create a character who shares a culture similar to your own, but of a different gender; you might play someone from a nation based on a culture that isn’t your own. That’s fine! When playing outside your own experiences there can be an impulse (or fear) that you need to do so “the right way.” While it’s true that cer- tain depictions or representations of marginalized groups are based on stereotypes, misinformation, or hate speech and are hurtful, there’s nothing wrong with playing some- one different from yourself if done so mindfully.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">What’s most important about playing outside your experi- ence is that you portray a whole <i>person</i>, not just an identi- ty or a label. The stories of <i>Avatar </i>are often about learning the depth of others’ experiences, even if we might not tru- ly understand what it’s like to live them. For example, Suki was upset by Sokka’s close-minded sexism but through training him in the traditions of the Kyoshi Warriors, she got him to overcome his upbringing and treat her like an equal. When you play <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, you can take the opportunity to consider other perspec- tives and challenge your preconceptions. In doing so, you have the chance to grow your own empathy with others as you play, just like your favorite heroes do.</p>

<a name="bookmark95">Name Your Character</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you’ve chosen your playbook, it’s time to give your character a name and decide what they look like. Names are gen- erally tied to the Four Nations so choose one that makes sense based on their origin or cultural heritage. Depending on the era of your game, your character’s name might directly connect to their heritage or culture (like in the divided world of the Kyoshi Era) or might reflect a diverse, cosmopolitan background (like in the more connected world of the Korra Era).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While watching <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>you may have noticed a lot of names are taken from real world cultures; the names provided in this book are no different. Although there is considerable variety in influences across the Four Nations, Earth Kingdom names are heavily inspired by Chinese names; Fire Nation names by Japanese names; Air Nomad names by Tibetan and Nepali names; and Water Tribe names by Inuit or Khmer names, alongside Vietnamese names for characters from the Foggy Swamp. Many of the names listed below are found within various real-world cultures, but the lists also feature fictitious names in keeping with the <i>Avatar </i>world. If you’d like a unique name for your character that isn’t listed below, read up on the cultures mentioned and their naming conventions to pick one which suits your character and their story.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Earth Kingdom</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom is vast with a wide variety of cultures among its people. Earth Kingdom names are composed of one or two syl- lables—many of these appear in the other three nations’ nomencla- tures, so feel free to use these names for Fire, Air, and Water charac- ters as well. Use one or two syllables for both given and surnames. Or you can use names of precious stones (e.g. Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl), plants (e.g. Peony, Camellia, Willow), or concepts (e.g.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Faith, Hope, Joy) as Earth Kingdom-style given names as well.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Water Tribes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Water Tribe characters go by a single name without a surname, but introduce themselves as “[name] of [homeland]” (e.g. “Bato of the Southern Water Tribe”). Water Tribe members often name children after beloved family members who’ve passed on as a way to gift the child with characteristics from their ances- tors. Choose a single name from the list on the next page.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Nation characters have given names and clan names, which act as surnames. They don’t usually mention their clan names when they introduce themselves, unless it’s relevant to the situation or they’re trying to show off for some reason. Families in the Fire Na- tion often like to pass individual syllables in their names on to one another: a woman named Zaagar might pass a syllable in her name on to her child, naming them Daozaa or Garrun.</p>
