</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A tabletop roleplaying game (sometimes abbreviated to TTRPG or RPG) is a storytelling game for three to six people played at a table—or online— with pen, paper, and dice. The game plays out as if you and your friends were cooperatively telling a story togeth- er. Over a few hours, your collective tale evolves and changes, go- ing to new and unexpected places based on the characters’ actions. You may even end up playing multiple sessions that build on the events of your first session and deepen the characters’ stories!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most players take on the role of a character in the setting of the game. Alongside your friends—who play their own characters— you describe what your character looks like and what they do. You say what they say, either describing their words (“I say something intimidating and glower at the guard!”) or speaking them verbatim (“I say, ‘I’ll never forgive the Fire Nation!’”). You think about how your character thinks and feels, and you guide all their actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One of your friends plays a special role—the gamemaster (GM). They portray the rest of the world, including all the other characters. They describe what every other character does or says and fill in any holes in the setting so that everyone at the table shares the same imaginary world in their heads. In a game focused on an existing property, like <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game</span>, the GM also helps to productively introduce existing elements like major characters or events from the setting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Very importantly, the GM isn’t playing <i>against </i>the other players. They’re here to try to represent the world faithfully while building out a set of interesting conflicts—to say what happens and what exists in a way that makes the fictional world <i>make sense</i>. And they’re here to keep things compelling and exciting—which includes honoring how awesome the other players’ characters are!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Your Heroes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>you play one of the many heroes of the Four Nations. Your goal is to protect the world from harm and stand up for those without the power to stand up for themselves. You fight on the side of what is right, even if that is the most difficult path to take, and you understand that to achieve peace there must be balance in all things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each player in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: the Roleplaying Game </span>creates their own hero using a playbook, a kind of hero archetype—a set of abilities and details and story elements all wrapped togeth- er to help you make the coolest character possible. Each hero is known as a <span class="s20">player character (PC) </span>in contrast to characters not controlled by the players called <span class="s20">non-player characters (NPCs)</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You and your fellow PCs are the main characters; your decisions matter the most to the tale you’re telling together. As you play, the GM presents the PCs with locations, situations, and characters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that create new, interesting choices and events. For example, your characters might be invited to a soiree at the Earth King’s palace, a spot you know will attract several thieves looking to steal the King’s precious jewels. Your GM describes what the party looks like, the in- teresting guests attending, the surprising events that take place, and the dangerous actions of the thieves. You decide what your heroes do to respond to the situation at hand!</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Rules</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the most part, a tabletop roleplaying game plays like a conver- sation—you take turns speaking, describing the action or sharing dialogue, reacting to each other, switching back and forth between in-character and out-of-character speech. But the conversation leads to places of uncertainty, times when no one knows what happens next. When one character tries to jump from a burning building to safety—across a ten-foot gap—no one knows for sure what hap- pens: do they make the jump or come crashing down?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In those moments, you turn to the game’s rules; they help you to figure out what happens in moments of <span class="s20">tense uncertain- ty</span>, guiding the conversation forward into new, interesting, and surprising outcomes. The rules themselves provide guidance on when they come into play, but most of the time, the GM has to provide some additional interpretation to help the mechanics fit the very specific situation in your game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s more, the GM also acts as a kind of impartial judge, help- ing the table determine when the rules come into play. If there’s ever doubt about whether or not the rules apply, the GM acts as the final arbiter and decision maker. If a character is jumping from a burning building, the GM might look at the rules and the situations in which they’re supposed to come into play, and then decide that, yes, there <i>absolutely is uncertainty here</i>. Time to go to the rules!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If, on the other hand, a character is jumping from one building to another when there’s no fire and the two buildings are practically touching, the GM might look at the rules, look at the situations in which they’re supposed to come into play, and decide that there’s <i>no real uncertainty here</i>. There’s no tension. The character just does it.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Story</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Telling a story together through roleplaying isn’t like writing a screenplay, in which a sole writer is in complete and total control over the narrative. Instead, the GM offers problems for the players to confront while making room to be surprised by how the PCs respond to the conflicts at hand, and the players make choices about what their characters do, playing off each other and finding out what happens together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, each individual story of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game </span>is like an <span class="s20">episode </span>of your own television show—the heroes learn about problems, figure out what they want to do, engage in some action, then discover the resolution of those</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">problems through their choices. But unlike those shows, nothing is scripted, and you play to find out what happens!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">But a single episode rarely resolves everything. You and your fel- low companions might defeat a dangerous villain and save a village from destruction, but that doesn’t mean that there are no further problems for the heroes to face. In fact, that defeated villain might reveal that there are larger forces in play, leading to the companions undertaking a larger mission that spans multiple sessions of play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That larger overarching story—composed of multiple, com- plete story episodes—is called a <span class="s20">season</span>. Sometimes groups only tell short stories, perhaps a single episode or just two or three, but often the longer stories are what makes roleplaying games truly memorable. After all, what could be better than getting to watch the heroes <i>you and your friends created </i>grow and change over the course of many adventures?</p>
