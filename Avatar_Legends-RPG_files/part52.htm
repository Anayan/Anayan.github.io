<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">can I Play A CANON CHARACTER?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">While the characters in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legend of Korra </i>are fantastic, their stories have already been told! When you play <span class="s56">Avatar Leg- ends: The Roleplaying Game </span>you have the chance to create your own unique hero who deals with similar challenges to those existing characters, while telling your own stories and exploring new (and famil-</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">iar) parts of the world. Of course, if you’re really interested in playing an existing character, you can absolutely do that…as long as everyone else at the table is excited about it too! Just bear in mind that this chapter is written to help create your own orig- inal characters, and that there is no other material on playing canonical characters in these rules.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">…<b>So can I be the Avatar? </b>The Avatar is the most powerful bender in the world during each age, rein- carnated endlessly to help bring balance to the world. It’s only natural that you might want to play as them, especially if you’re a longtime fan. However, each era already has an established Avatar! If you’re playing in Roku’s Era, Roku is struggling to maintain international peace and his friendship with Fire Lord Sozin. If you’re playing in the Hundred Year War Era, Aang is frozen beneath the waters of the South Pole. In many cases, the endings of these stories are already written (even if there are gaps here and there). This text is written assuming you are not playing the Avatar.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The most important reason there aren’t rules for playing the Avatar is that being the Avatar creates an imbalance of narrative importance in the game— you’re the main character, even if you don’t want or intend to be! This means that the other players can get pushed to the side and get less spotlight time during the game. While the rest of your Team Av- atar are important to the story, whoever plays the Avatar will inevitably get the lion’s share of atten- tion in the game as NPCs seek them out for advice or to mediate disputes, challenge their rulings, or try to sway them to support their cause. In normal play, every character in <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game </span>is as important as everyone else, and every character gets to contribute to the story equally in their own unique ways!</p>
