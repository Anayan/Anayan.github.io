<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Aang Era specifically details the state of the world just after the conclusion of the <i>Imbalance </i>comic trilogy. The Hundred Year War is finally over thanks to Avatar Aang and his team. This era is one of hope after a long stretch of strife. It is a time of possibility, coopera- tion, and healing, restoring balance to the world. For the first time in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">years, the nations have a chance at true cooperation, but many strug- gle with embracing the forgiveness needed for collaboration. Plenty fight against progress towards social and political cooperation, and those who cannot change find themselves left behind, holding onto narrow-minded attitudes that are quickly becoming outdated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Zuko now sits on the <span class="s20">Fire Nation </span>throne after joining forces with the Avatar to stop his father, and he faces unhappy citizens who’ve made attempts on his life. Aang and Zuko work to repair the damage done by the Fire Nation during the war, but de- spite their best intentions, it hasn’t always turned out the way they’d like. Decolonization is well underway in the <span class="s20">Earth Kingdom</span>
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark62" class="s22">. The Harmony Restoration Movement (page 70)</a> was intended to es- tablish balance among the nations by moving Fire Nation colonists back to the Fire Nation, but it wasn’t universally embraced. Many people didn’t want to be forced out of settlements they had lived in for so long, and multicultural families did not want to be broken up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While some in the Earth Kingdom strive to remain integrated, other places push to separate—and not always due to nationality, but also to increasing tensions between benders and non-benders. This is exemplified by the bending supremacist uprising in Crane- fish Town. Though the Avatar and his team stopped the uprising, plenty of people (most of them benders, though not all) believe only benders should be in leadership roles. Tensions caused by the bending supremacist movement aren’t going away any time soon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Water Tribes </span>face their own obstacles on the path</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark64" class="s22">towards healing. The Southern Water Tribe slowly works on reconstruction after a century of extreme hardship during the war, but rebuilding has come with its own set of problems… The Northern Water Tribe assisted in the Southern Reconstruc- tion Project, an endeavor meant to repair its sister tribe, only to make a play for the South’s valuable oil depository. Maliq (page 73),</a> an engineer sent by the Northern Water Tribe, believed that oil-fueled machinery created equality between non-benders and benders, but the Southerners ultimately forced him and the other workers to withdraw.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This era is a surreal time for many people—the first time in a century when the nations haven’t been in direct conflict. A generation of children who’ve only known war finally get a taste</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of peace. Some wounds, such as the genocide of the <span class="s20">Air Nomads </span>or the loss of loved ones during the war, cannot be repaired. Even so, there is more promise for the future than in over a century, and the heroes of this era must see that promise fulfilled.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Avatar Aang</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark53" class="s22">Avatar Aang is technically over a hundred years old, but is actually just a teenager. When he was twelve, he learned he would become the next Avatar and fled his responsibilities in fear. He was caught in a storm and reflexively entered the Avatar State, freezing himself and his sky bison Appa in an iceberg for protection. Fire Lord Sozin launched his attack on the other nations instigating the Hundred Year War (page 56)</a> while Aang and Appa remained frozen for nearly a century. When he awoke, Aang was stunned to learn that the world was at war and devastated that his people, the Air Nomads, were all dead. Now, he is the only living Airbender, though he has recently started mentoring a group called the Air Acolytes to keep Air Nomad culture alive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Aang has been busy since coming out of the iceberg. With the help of his friends, he fought Fire Lord Ozai and brought an end to the Hundred Year War, kept civil unrest from breaking out</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the former Fire colonies, and halted a bending supremacist uprising… just to name a few of his activities. Aang had to grow into his role, as all Avatars do, but he truly wants to see balance restored to the world and is willing to put in the work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark70" class="s22">In his personal life, he has started a romantic relationship with Katara, a Southern Water Tribe Waterbender, and cement- ed his unlikely friendship with Fire Lord Zuko. Aang and Zuko’s friendship has a special importance in the world of diplomatic relations, as it serves an essential part of restoring balance between the Four Nations. Now, Aang and Katara spend much of their time and attention on the industry-focused Cranefish Town. Aang hopes it becomes a thriving, inclusive community despite the problems it has faced. Little does he know that this area is destined to become one of the most important cities in the world—Republic City (page 82).</a>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">People all over the globe confront the trauma they suffered throughout the war and find ways to move forward as best they can. For those who lost loved ones, homes, or parts of their culture like the Southern Water Tribe did, the path forward is especially challenging. Not everyone heals the same way, and one person’s healing journey might be another person’s night- mare. Someone who heals themselves by investing all their energy into doing something productive may not understand someone who needs time alone to heal.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark62" class="s25">Each nation is experiencing political and societal changes, and so are their citizens. Some of these changes are more painful and face more resistance than others, such as when Fire Lord Zuko and Earth King Kuei tried to move Fire Nation colonists out of the Earth Kingdom (page </a>70). Even those who want</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">to embrace change and growth may become impatient when things don’t change fast enough or when they run into obstacles along the way. The path towards the future of the Four Nations is a rocky one, but at least there is a path.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Four Nations were divided for a century, and now people must learn how to coexist alongside each other. Some are eager to go out and explore a diverse world and see what it has to offer or what they can contribute to it, but others wish for na- tions to isolate themselves. Some believe decolonization means all people should return to the land of their ancestors, while others feel integration is the way to achieve peace. One way or another, the world must learn how to operate now that the Fire Nation is an ally instead of a foe.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">New technologies bring limitless possibilities to the world, but not everyone is happy with this rapid push into the future. The Southern Water Tribe struggles with holding onto its cultural identity while also embracing rapid industrialization and ren- ovation. Meanwhile, technological advancement in Cranefish Town means non-benders can find more work than ever, but at the same time, benders are being made redundant by machines. These seeds of discord took root, splitting the inhabitants of the town right down the middle and giving birth to the first bending supremacist movement. Now, aftershocks of that movement’s insurrection ripple throughout the world.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is a list of important events, which occur leading up to and during this era. Each event has a list of the current consequences for the stories you craft in this era.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The End of the Hundred Year War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Only a couple of years ago, Avatar Aang brought an end to the war with the help of allies from all nations. The final battle took place when Ozai had just named himself Phoenix King and Azu- la was crowned Fire Lord in her father’s stead. Both Firebenders were greatly empowered by Sozin’s Comet flying overhead, which amplified their firebending powers, but Aang still took</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on Ozai while Zuko and Katara battled Azula. Meanwhile, the Avatar’s other allies, including Uncle Iroh, Toph Beifong, Sokka, and Suki, halted the advance of the Fire Nation airship fleet into the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After Aang defeated Fire Lord Ozai and stripped him of his bending abilities, Ozai was imprisoned for his crimes in Hari Bulkan Prison near the Royal Palace. Now, Fire Lord Zuko gov- erns the Fire Nation as the world grapples with how it has been changed by the war, from the genocide of the Air Nomads to the existence of new multicultural post-colonial societies.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Avatar Aang is the only Air Nomad left.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Fire Nation citizens face stigma for their nation’s actions during the war.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Many people now come from multicultural backgrounds.</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Harmony Restoration Movement</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not long after the end of the Hundred Year War, Earth King Kuei and Fire Lord Zuko made an agreement to extract Fire Nation colonists from the Earth Kingdom. The first year went smoothly, and people from the newer colonies were excited to return home. However, the movement met resistance when the citizens of the much older colony of Yu Dao refused to relocate. Many had been there for generations, and even some Earth Kingdom citizens fought against the movement to protect their friends and family. Not all Earth Kingdom citizens felt that way, though, and many took to the streets to protest letting the Fire Nation colonists stay. Both King Kuei and Fire Lord Zuko sent troops to Yu Dao, and war very nearly broke out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Luckily, Avatar Aang and his allies prevented the battle from escalating, and the movement ended with Yu Dao electing a new government with both Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation representatives. On the international stage, Fire Lord Zuko and King Kuei signed the Treaty of Yu Dao helping to secure peace between their two nations. Additionally, Zuko agreed to pay war reparations to the Earth Kingdom to help them rebuild, which was an unpopular choice with some Fire Nation citizens.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Fire Nation colonists still live in the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Many people on both sides are unhappy with how the movement ended.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Earth King and Fire Lord both face criticisms for how they handled the movement.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">New Ozai Society Uprising</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New Ozai Society is a clandestine group whose goal is to reinstate Ozai as Fire Lord. They see Zuko as a weak Fire Lord who does not prioritize his people the way his father did. The group launched attacks on Zuko and his family, but were de- feated. Though the leader, Ukano, turned himself in, the group has many members with some still at large. Ukano truly did not trust Zuko, but he was manipulated into attacking the young Fire Lord by Azula, Zuko’s sister, who threatened Ukano while she was disguised as a dark spirit.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Reconstruction Project</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Water Tribe started to rebuild and modernize with the help of its northern counterpart and the other nations, but tensions between the two tribes is an obstacle. Hakoda, the Head Chieftain of the Southern Water Tribe, agreed to work with two architects from the Northern Water Tribe to urbanize Capital City and its surrounding areas. They built an oil refinery, but the North intended to take control of the oil, believing the South inadequate to manage the resource. Gilak, a warrior from the Southern Water Tribe, led a group against the northerners but fell to his death in an attack. The threat of violence has calmed since Gilak’s death, but conflict between the two tribes is still palpable.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Southern Water Tribe citizens are still unhappy Hakoda, the Southern Water Tribe chief, wants cooperation with the North.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Relations between the North and South are strained.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bending Supremacist Uprising</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the rapidly growing Earth Kingdom settlement of Cranefish Town, some benders lost jobs to new machinery operable by anyone. Many of these benders harbored feelings of superior- ity over non-benders, and unrest broke out between the two groups, with non-bender workers targeted for violence and a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">ban proposed on public acts of bending. An Earthbender factory owner named Liling capitalized on the growing chaos and organized a group of bending supremacists to sabotage business- es with the aim of putting the town under bender control. The Avatar and his friends ended this movement, but the bending supremacist sentiment has not vanished and has a lasting impact on the world beyond this era (page 80).</a>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Aang is the only Airbender in the world, Air Nomad culture lives on through the Air Acolytes—a group created by the Avatar dedicated to keeping Nomad traditions alive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes originated from the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, which was so popular it had several chapters in different locations. At first, Aang was skeptical of the members’ desire to incorporate all things Air Nomad into their lives, but he now teaches the acolytes all about Air Nomad celebrations, practices, stories, and philosophy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Air Temples are still in rough shape after the Hundred Year War and decades of disrepair, but with the number of Air Acolytes growing, it may be time to start repairs soon. There are relics to reclaim, lost lives to honor, and old responsibilities to uphold. The path forward may not be entirely clear, but as Aang continues to gain new allies in the form of the Acolytes, the future looks brighter and brighter.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Xing Ying</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Avatar Aang Fan Club president turned Air Acolyte</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Xing Ying, one of the first Air Acolytes, made a bad first impres- sion on Aang because she had Airbender master tattoos despite not being an Airbender. As the president of the Yu Dao chapter of the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, Xing Ying learned every- thing she could about Aang and the Air Nomads. Her love of the culture inspired her to get the tattoos, but she failed to realize how doing so was disrespectful to Air Nomad tradition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now, Xing Ying wears a headband to cover up part of her tattoo but continues to study Air Nomad culture with great enthusiasm. Prospective Air Acolytes would be wise to spend time traveling with Xing Ying before joining. Though Xing Ying prefers resolving conflict through communication, in unavoidable fights she is very capable of defending herself. When possible, she always tries to bring the fight to a swift and peaceful conclusion.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jingbo</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A committed Air Acolyte looking to help in whatever way he can <span class="p">Jingbo is an eager Air Acolyte who wants to help the Avatar through thoughtful dedication. He struggles with certain aspects of Air Nomad traditions, namely meditation, but his commit- ment to the Acolytes is steadfast. Though he isn’t a bender, Jing- bo doesn’t hesitate to enter a dangerous situation if it means he can protect others or defend Air Nomad ideals. He also doesn’t mind taking on more mundane tasks, such as carrying supplies, and is happy to participate as an Acolyte in any way possible.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jingbo’s earnest enthusiasm can provide aspiring Acolytes with insight into the less romantic truths of being an Acolyte and help people differentiate between the fantasy and reality of joining.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yee-Li</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Air Acolyte keeping tradition alive</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yee-Li is one of the founding members of the Ba Sing Se chapter of the Avatar Aang Fan Club. One of the original Air Acolytes, she is so dedicated to keeping Air Nomad tradition alive that Toph, one of Aang’s closest allies, has accused her of focusing too much on the past. Toph’s criticism has not deterred Yee-Li, however.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark65" class="s22">Yee-Li is particularly fond of Air Nomad music, and she plays the cymbals when the Acolytes play together. Interestingly, Yee-Li has a soft spot for The Dark One (page 74),</a> one of Toph’s first</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">metalbending students, even though her personality is much more cheerful and his is more brooding. If heroes need to take on a particularly daunting task, Yee-Li might be able to get both the Air Acolytes and the Beifong Metalbenders on their side.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reviving Air Nomad Culture</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Finding What Was Lost</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes have a challenging task in learning and preserv- ing Air Nomad culture, and not just because they have only one living Air Nomad to learn from. So much that belonged to the Air Nomads was destroyed during the Hundred Year War. This makes every relic and piece of documentation especially pre- cious now. Much of what survived in the war was stolen, often by the Fire Nation. In addition to recovering the physical pieces of Air Nomad history, the Air Acolytes do their best to memorize how holidays are celebrated, stories told, and rituals conducted, so that they don’t have to rely on Aang to give them instructions.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Appropriation vs. Appreciation</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Growing Pains</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s not always clear where the line is between preserving Air Nomad culture and appropriating it in a disrespectful way. For instance, Airbender tattoos can only be earned through years of mastering airbending forms and Air Nomad philosophy. Though Avatar Aang believes that the Acolytes have the hearts of Air Nomads, there are still lines that shouldn’t be crossed. Figuring out those lines and being willing to learn from mistakes is all a part of the Air Acolytes’ mission. Heroes may need to contend with aspiring Acolytes who don’t care about these boundaries, especially if they cause problems by pretending to be experts on all things Air Nomad.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maintaining Balance with Spirits</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes already had their first run-in with the Spirit World when the Earthen Fire Refinery provoked the ire of the ancient spirit General Old Iron (featured in <i>The Rift </i>comic series). The Acolytes are quickly learning that making peace with spirits is a big part of what the Air Nomads did, and now they share that responsibility. They must not only consider the agreements that Avatar Yangchen made with spirits long ago, but how to help the Avatar when he seeks to foster balance between humans and spirits. And if they can’t reach Aang in a crisis, hopefully the Acolytes have learned enough from him to act!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes have been busy since the end of the war. The Southern Water Tribe expanded considerably in a short span of time, though the road to revitalization hasn’t been without its obstacles. Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes during the Southern Reconstruction Project finally blew up after a conflict over an oil depository. The Northern Water Tribe sent people to oversee the project, and when they discov- ered the oil depository there, the North attempted to quietly claim control of the resource. Conflict broke out between both tribes, and Gilak, the leader of the southern nationalist uprising, died…though his resentment lives on in many other Southern Tribe members.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hakoda is the current Head Chieftain of the Southern Water</p>

<a href="part30.htm#bookmark56" class="s22">Tribe, while Chief Arnook (page 60)</a> still governs the North, with the South ultimately answering to him as well. Some south- erners fear that the Northern Tribe’s influence and the rate of growth will lead to the Southern Water Tribe’s cultural identity fading. It is hard to completely disregard these fears, seeing as the South Pole is already all but unrecognizable as the same South Pole from before the war.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To that end a younger faction of Southern Water Tribe peo- ple work towards recovering their people’s cultural identity. New Waterbenders are born and strive to discover how their powers connect to their people’s culture. The youth believe their peo- ple’s stories don’t have to fade into history and can be integrated into the tribe’s new future. They’ve set about collecting stories and objects thought lost during the war and archiving them for future generations.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Katara</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A kindhearted waterbending master working to help those in need <a href="part29.htm#bookmark54" class="s22">Katara is one of the few surviving Waterbenders from the South- ern Water Tribe and an essential part of the Avatar’s team. She lost her mother to the Fire Nation’s raiders (page 58)</a>
<span class="p"> and was sepa- rated from her father, Hakoda, while he was off fighting. Together with her older brother Sokka, she helped to bring about the end of the war and continues to aid Avatar Aang whenever she can.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In addition to being an amazing waterbending fighter, Katara is a skilled healer whose talent only grows more powerful with time. She can teach both forms of waterbending, combat and healing, to benders who want to improve their abilities and doesn’t restrict anyone based on gender. Katara is kind, optimis- tic, and protective of her friends. She has a hard time saying no to people in trouble and therefore takes on more than she and her allies can handle.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sokka</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A loyal warrior with a passion for complex plans</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the past couple of years, Sokka has come into his own as a warrior and an individual. He works with Aang to restore peace and fought alongside him and Katara to end the war. He’s trained as a warrior since his youth and often uses a boomerang in combat. More recently, he trained as a swordsman and forged his own sword out of a meteorite, which he subsequently lost when he foiled a Fire Nation airship attack on the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark66" class="s22">Sokka tends to take things less seriously than his younger sister Katara, but is fiercely loyal to his loved ones. If something were to happen to any of them, he would do whatever it takes to save them. Likewise, if something were to happen to him, he has plenty of people who would stop at nothing to rescue him, including his formidable girlfriend Suki (page 75),</a> the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hakoda</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Chieftain of the quickly growing Southern Water Tribe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the Chieftain of the Southern Water Tribe, Hakoda must call on all the leadership skills he used during the war to lead an</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">expanding community. Hakoda is an intelligent, open, and char- ismatic leader. When he isn’t keeping the Southern and Northern Water Tribes from arguing with one another, he focuses on shap- ing the future of his tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Should they hold strictly to the spiritual traditions of the past or focus on keeping up with the industrial endeavors of other nations? Should the tribe make compromises to appease the North, or should they forge a separate identity? He tackles these questions daily, and the more help he can get, the better. Heroes who want to help have plenty of opportunities to do so as the Chieftain is both trying to grow the tribe and navigate political conflicts that sometimes turn violent.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Malina</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An architect from the Northern Water Tribe living in the South Pole <span class="p">Malina, a Waterbender and brilliant architect, comes from the Northern Water Tribe but now lives with the South. Anyone near the South Pole who needs help with an engineering endeavor would be hard pressed to find someone more capable. Malina recently started a romantic relationship with Hakoda and has been assisting in the Southern Water Tribe’s continued development.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">When Malina first arrived in the South, she originally intend- ed to help the Northern Water Tribe take control, but she ulti- mately changed her mind and decided it was better for the South to grow on their own terms. Her brother, Maliq, did not share her opinion, causing some strife between them. Malina is a good ally for anyone who needs to investigate why certain engineering projects fail and if there’s sabotage involved.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An engineer who wants to see the Northern Water Tribe’s dominance <span class="p">Like his sister Malina, Maliq is an architect and engineer from the Northern Water Tribe. He came to the Southern Water Tribe to as- sist in the Southern Reconstruction Project, believing that the tribe was incapable of helping themselves. Maliq was forced to return to the Northern Water Tribe along with the other northerners who came with the same agenda. Unsurprisingly, his relationship with his sister is strained since their disagreement about the project.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Maliq now works on a plan to convince his sister that he was right about the Southern Water Tribe’s weaknesses as he moves between the North and the South. He will go to great lengths to make his point because he believes it to be for the greater good of both tribes. His biggest advantage is that Malina would love for her brother to turn a new leaf—Maliq could take advantage of that love she has for him.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nakul</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nakul, a young storykeeper from the Southern Water Tribe, trav- els from village to village collecting stories from the South. After being orphaned in the war, Nakul moved around frequently throughout the years and experienced the enduring spirit of her people through the different memories shared with her by her caretakers. Now, as a young adult, she wants to bring this living history to all members of her tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Nakul dreams of building a giant storyhouse in Wolf Cove with archives of all the history she’s collected over the years. She intends to include history not only from the South, but from the North as well, in hopes that discovering shared stories</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">might help heal the bad blood between the two tribes. Currently, Nakul and her fellow storykeepers struggle with reaching the most remote villages of both North and South to collect their stories and could use competent warriors to protect them on their journeys.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the end of the war, the existing tension between the two Water Tribes grows, and the South is rife with murmurs of anti-Northern sentiment. Southern Tribe citizens feel that the Northerners acted selfishly by not providing any assistance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">during the war and now see any Northern offer to help as oppor- tunistic and often selfish. The North’s recent attempt to claim the Southern Tribes’ oil depository stoked fears of the North’s weakness for corruption, and members of the Northern Water Tribe are not especially welcome in the South Pole right now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any earnest offer of help from the North is met with suspicion, as the South isn’t ready to forgive their sister tribe for abandon- ing them during the war. Heroes who need the assistance of both tribes will be hard pressed to get them to cooperate without an argument breaking out, and people from both tribes may even demand them to pick a side.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: left;">Prejudiced Perceptions of the Southern Water Tribe</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The people of the Southern Water Tribe are among this world’s most resilient survivors, and now that the war is over, they finally have a chance to return to important traditions. It is a time of both remembrance and renewal, and one of the things the tribe needs most right now is time to reconnect with their cultural identity after being forced to focus only on survival for so long. This renais- sance of cultural celebration comes with new industrial growth as the South rebuilds much of what was lost during the war.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most people throughout the world don’t recognize the Southern Water Tribe for its strength, despite the clear example of their prowess when their warriors helped the Avatar defeat Fire Lord Ozai. When they look at the tribe in comparison to its Northern counterpart, which has industrialized significantly throughout the war, they see a collection of villages that has seemingly only just begun to form a larger “civilization”.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation may have freed its Waterbender prisoners at the end of the war, but many of them must still heal from the trauma of their extended imprisonment. Some of the prisoners are elderly, and returning home is only the beginning of their recovery. Some may not feel comfortable in the South Pole after all the changes it’s gone through and how much time they’ve spent away. Still others may discover they have an emotional block that prevents them from waterbending. Those who wish to help these former prisoners have several options, but each recovering Waterbender is a unique case. Helpful heroes could reunite a former prisoner with their long-lost loved ones, find answers to what happened to missing friends, try to figure out how to restore their bending, or accompany them on a quest for revenge against war criminals.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One way the Earth Kingdom progresses towards decolo- nization is focusing on technological innovation, which helps to bridge the divide between natives and colonizers.

In the past, the factory only employed benders to work the production lines because they needed Earthbenders to extract the crystals, Waterbenders to purify them, and Firebenders to heat the ovens. And now thanks to recent mechanical upgrades, non-benders can work alongside benders here. The Earthen Fire Refinery employs so many peo- ple that a settlement named Cranefish Town sprouted up nearby.

Toph learned earthbending from badger-moles instead of human teachers, which partly accounts for her unique bending style. Being blind has led her to de- velop a bending-led way to sense people and objects through vibrations in the earth; she can even sense changes in people’s breathing and heartbeats, making her a human lie detector. As- piring benders—especially disabled students seeking a teacher with similar experiences—may seek her out for training because of her unprecedented skill, but she is a tough teacher. When</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A powerful businessman vested in the future of Cranefish Town</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lao Beifong is the co-founder of Earthen Fire Refinery in Cranefish Town. He is also Toph’s father, though they were estranged until re- cently. Like his daughter, Lao can be stubborn and hardheaded, and he shows his love for Toph by worrying about what’s best for her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lao is a knowledgeable businessman who tries to prioritize the well-being of his employees. Noticing that Cranefish Town was growing rapidly and crime was on the rise, he created the lo- cal Business Council to govern the town. Concerned that bend- ers were using their abilities to rob non-benders, he proposed to outlaw public bending. This fueled the beginnings of the Bender Supremacist Uprising, and while Aang and his allies stopped it, Lao has lingering fears. Now that things have calmed down, he guides aspiring entrepreneurs and does what he can to employ locals looking for work.</p>

Kuei, now active in the governance of his city and nation, does his best to improve the Earth Kingdom and its relations with the other nations. Unfortunately, he overcompensates for his embarrassing past, such as when he led an army against the Fire Nation colo- nists who didn’t want to leave Yu Dao…fortunately, the Avatar was there to set him on the right path!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kuei’s beloved and pampered pet bear, Bosco, often travels with him, which makes him cut a more flamboyant figure than most kings. Those looking to help the Earth Kingdom recover from the war might seek Kuei out for an assignment. Conversely, heroes who notice Kuei taking an ill-advised path may try to convince him to take another one.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beifong Metalbending Academy</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The world’s first metalbenders</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Beifong Metalbending Academy is located near Yu Dao in what used to be a firebending dojo during the occupation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Toph Beifong had a rocky start with her first three students, their progress shows promise for the future of metal- bending. Those first three students—Ho Tun, Penga, and The Dark One—now teach classes at the academy. Ho Tun can</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be a bit anxious at times, the young Penga is working through obsessive habits, and The Dark One’s first true love is poetry, but all three are capable Earthbenders with metalbending abilities, and each is dedicated to helping where they are needed. They even assisted in the Southern Reconstruction Project (page</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark62" class="s22">70)</a> in the South Pole. Because metalbending is still a newly discovered form of bending, anyone in need of an Earthbender with metalbending training must come to the academy. Though the number of students is growing, it’s often Ho Tun, Penga, and The Dark One who get sent out on missions.</p>

<span class="p">32) founded the Kyoshi Warriors for the purpose of protecting Yokoya Peninsula (now Kyoshi Island).

<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and has shared her chi-blocking mastery with many other war- riors. The group is entirely made up of women, except for Sokka, Suki’s boyfriend, who was briefly an honorary member.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of extremists who believe benders are inherently superior <span class="p">Though the bender supremacist uprising was quelled, some peo- ple still feel that benders are superior to non-benders and worry about machines replacing benders in the workplace. Liling, the leader of the bending supremacist movement in Cranefish Town, believed non-benders should not hold positions of power as they are inherently weaker. Despite her best efforts to start a war—and to kill her daughter, Ru, for abandoning the cause to side with the Avatar—Liling failed and now resides in Cranefish Town’s prison, though she may be moved to a more secure location soon.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Cranefish Town was the seat of this bigotry-fueled conflict, but people throughout the Earth Kingdom and the rest of the world share the same ideas about the superiority of benders. Bending supremacists sabotage factories where benders have lost jobs to machines and carry out attacks on non-benders in power, giving the heroes ample opportunity to foil their plans if they know what to look out for.</p>

Young people with one parent from the Earth Kingdom and one from the Fire Nation may feel their loyalties do not lie with any single nation, but with their unique mixed community. Diverse settlements like Crane- fish Town are attractive to citizens looking for belonging that isn’t dependent on being accepted by any one nation. However, they may also attract unwanted attention from people who don’t believe cultures should mix.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So much was lost during the war. Some refugees stay in Ba Sing Se’s Lower Ring and others move back to the villages they evacuat- ed—if those villages still stand. Rebuilding pillaged villages isn’t only a physically laborious task, but an emotionally taxing one as well. Some people have lingering unanswered questions about the fates of loved ones they were separated from during the war. A few may find closure by confirming a loved one’s death or reuniting with them, but others must choose between devoting themselves to hunting down answers they may never find or moving forward without those answers. Heroes may want to embark on an epic journey to track down a friend who went missing during the war or stay close to home to fight off bandits taking advantage of their recovering village. They may even want revenge against a friend who betrayed them in the heat of battle to save their own skin.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For refugees living in the Lower Ring, the end of the war hasn’t brought much in the way of relief. The area is still overcrowded, and the government does not provide enough resources to the citizens who live there. Those in the Lower Ring may feel forgot- ten as the rest of the world starts to heal. Some of the problems that plague the Lower Ring include poverty, crime, poor sanita- tion, and overcrowding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though the corruption in the government is better since Long Feng was deposed, the Lower Ring is still a vulnerable target for crime bosses and government officials alike who take advantage of this chaotic time. Heroes who want to spend some time in the Lower Ring have plenty to keep them occupied between all the growing criminal organizations. It’s also a great place for someone to go into hiding.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Hundred Year War is over, Zuko is now Fire Lord, and the Fire Nation must now contend with its bloody history of imperi- alism. Since his tumultuous ascension to the throne, Zuko faces constant attacks by those who want his imprisoned father reinstat- ed. While Ozai remains in prison, stripped of his bending, Zuko’s sister Azula is still at large. Despite these challenges, the new Fire Lord and his allies are set on steering the Fire Nation away from its imperialist history and towards a world united in harmony.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It is a strange time to be a Fire Nation citizen or colonist. Much of the world still resents the Fire Nation because of the grievous harm its government and military inflicted, and many do not know how to feel about its civilians. After all, many will- ingly supported Fire Lord Ozai’s regime or allied with it in fear of punishment. For the first time in a century, the people of the Fire Nation must learn what it means to be part of the world and not just a part of the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">To that end many Fire Nation citizens work where they can to repair some of the damage inflicted by the war. As a result of Zuko’s reforms, scholars strive to recover lost history and elimi-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nate deceitful propaganda long taught in school texts; Fire Nation inventors contact Earth Kingdom colleagues to collaborate for the first time in over a century; and the Fire Nation now crafts policy to ensure nothing like the Hundred Year War ever happens again.</p>

Trying to do things differently and turn back decades of wrongdoing is no small task. Between upsetting people with the attempted Harmony Restoration Move- ment, fending off assassination attempts, and contending with his sister Azula’s machinations, Zuko has a lot on his hands.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Some citizens of the Fire Nation don’t believe what is best for the rest of the world is what is best for them, and that makes Zuko feel like he must choose between them and diplomatic relations. Though he may doubt himself sometimes, it is clear to his closest friends, like Avatar Aang, that he will have a tremen- dous influence on the world for the better. Heroes hoping to improve diplomatic relations between nations might serve the Fire Lord directly, try to protect his life against threats, or work with him on restoration projects.</p>

He is one of the Avatar’s wisest and most com- passionate allies and helps anyone fighting for harmony and jus- tice. The Fire Lord is like another son to him, and Iroh has stood by Zuko through thick and thin. Though he mostly spends his days running his tea shop, the Jasmine Dragon in Ba Sing Se, he still aids Zuko and the Avatar whenever he can, even stepping in as interim Fire Lord when Zuko needs to attend to personal matters. Additionally, he still serves as a Grand Lotus in the Order of the White Lotus. Those looking to join the White Lotus in order to help bring peace to the world would be wise to seek him out.</span>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark62" class="s22">After failing to defeat the Avatar and his allies with her father, Azula was institutionalized rather than imprisoned, as the fight pushed the princess to her breaking point. Zuko then withdrew Azula from the institution to help search for their missing moth- er Ursa, but Azula used the mission as a chance to try to kill her instead. After that, she disguised herself as a dark spirit, in order to manipulate the New Ozai Society (page 70)</a> into attacking Zuko…to make him strong, or so she claims.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite everything that has happened Azula may very well care for the welfare of her brother…though their relationship remains tenuous. Azula still has the remaining Fire Warriors at her disposal, but she could choose to strike out on her own</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">instead. Chances are she isn’t far from Zuko, and she is unlikely to be willingly taken alive.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the war Nergüi only ever acted with the belief that the Fire Nation brought prosperity to the world, even as he took on heinous missions for his home nation. Every horrible thing he’d done was put into question when Ozai was defeated, and the extent of his genocidal plans became apparent. For the first time in his life, Nergüi suffered a crisis of faith. After a year of despair, Nergüi swore to dedicate his remaining years to undoing the wrong he inflicted on the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To that end, Nergüi still works as a spy…but for the new government. He specializes in hunting down the worst offenders of the Hundred Year War and bringing them in to stand trial for their crimes. Nergüi is still learning what it means to be on the right side of things and while his espionage skills may be un- paralleled, he always benefits from people who provide a moral compass on his missions.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Warriors</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Azula’s mysterious group of warriors plotting their next move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Warriors are a group led by Azula who impersonated dark spirits, Kemurikage, to manipulate the New Ozai Society. The group was comprised of women Azula broke out of mental health institutions, as Azula herself was in a similar facility after Zuko and Katara defeated her at the end of the Hundred Year War. The Fire Warriors went so far as to abduct children to make themselves more believable as local dark spirits, but Avatar Aang, Zuko, Mai, and the Kyoshi Warriors rescued them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though many of the Fire Warriors were captured, Azula and a handful of others managed to get away. With their numbers reduced—and Azula not necessarily standing by the group she founded—the Fire Warriors are wantonly reckless with their plans. They might target heroes who help Zuko or find ways to turn other citizens against their Fire Lord.</p>

If there are strange goings-on in Cranefish Town, Satoru knows about them.</span>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation’s military grievously harmed the other nations under Ozai’s rule, and not everyone is willing to trust Fire Na- tion citizens. In some parts of the world, Fire Nation citizens are used to walking freely and openly, the advantage of being on the side of successful conquerors; now no longer a privileged class, they are treated as ordinary people or outcasts. In other parts of the world, people aren’t used to seeing Fire Nation citizens at all without accompanying soldiers and officers of the Fire Army.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Few understand this conundrum as deeply as the scholars and investigators responsible for documenting the Fire Nation’s war crimes in an attempt to formulate appropriate reparations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Investigators’ jobs are difficult in that they must investigate crimes that took place all throughout the war, often with little to no recorded evidence save for numerous first-person accounts. No matter what investigators conclude, their reports are highly contested for being biased one way or another. Heroes who want to help the Fire Nation with reparations could aid investigators in compiling evidence and hunting down war criminals still at large.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While some officials openly criticize Fire Lord Zuko, others hold their tongues while secretly plotting to get rid of him. These plots aren’t solely focused on the Fire Lord himself—they may include his entire cabinet of advisors. Government officials who came to power after Ozai was ousted fight against a century of hate for a peaceful future. They work openly and honestly with the Fire Lord, engaging in hours of discussion and debate of what the future of the Fire Nation should be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Hiding amongst these officials are politicians who outwardly agree with the Fire Lord’s plans, but secretly conspire against him. They also work against their colleagues, stir up hate, and try to swiftly thwart any plan towards progress. If heroes could find a way to uncover these traitors, it would go a long way towards reforming the Fire Nation’s political system.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation works to establish peaceful relations with the other nations, but it’s hard to shrug off a century’s worth of pro- paganda. Some citizens and former officials alike still believe the rest of the world would be better off under Fire Nation rule. When foreigners visit the Fire Nation, they might run into prejudiced individuals who don’t want them there and business owners who don’t want to offer their services. Similarly, when Fire Nation citizens visit other nations for the first time, they may be surprised to find that these places are not like how they were depicted in propaganda. Heroes from other nations who don’t want to stand out may have a difficult time if they run into those holding onto wartime prejudices. Antagonistic groups like the Fire Warriors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">or New Ozai Society may take advantage of people’s prejudice in</p>
