<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Agendas are your high-level goals. Think of them as the <i>reason</i>
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">you’re running the game. Your agendas are:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Ensure the world feels real</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Make the PCs’ stories meaningful and important</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Play to find out what happens</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ensure the world feels real</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roleplaying games aren’t about winning or losing. If you want players to care, they must feel that the world they explore is real, with actual stakes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Think about what could believably happen when players take action. Make sure that the companions’ actions all have believ- able consequences, even if they happen later down the line. If they hurt an innocent bystander, for example, how would those around the bystander react? And if the PCs have a fight against a powerful opponent and wind up smashing an entire town to splinters, wouldn’t they incur the ire of the townsfolk?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">And remember, “believable” is not the opposite of “fantasti- cal.” This is the Avatarverse after all, where spirits and elemental bending can be found around every corner. Consistency is key to keeping everything believable. If your Airbender easily knocks back the Fire Nation soldiers with a gust of wind the first time, you should have a decent reason why it doesn’t work the next time when the dice go awry. Maybe these ones are trained to weave out of the way? Or they happen to grab onto something? Your explanation of what happens in the world has to constantly reinforce the consistency of the fiction.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Make the PCs’ stories meaningful and important <span class="p">The player characters are the protagonists of the story. NPCs help or hinder them along their journey, but it’s your job to ensure the NPCs don’t draw too much attention away from the PCs. The world contains monarchs, Avatars, spirits, and more… but this is not their story. This is the story of the companions, who through grit, courage, and skill, make meaningful change. Make sure you don’t focus a lot of time showing what the NPCs do. It’s crucial to give the PCs the spotlight to act and react to NPCs’ actions.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, you are not the PCs’ adversary—you’re their guide and chronicler. Don’t throw challenges and enemies at them to “test” how well they know the rules or to “wear them down.” Whatever challenges the companions face, ensure they are there to make the characters’ lives exciting and to allow them to take part in meaningful stories. <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is an adventure game, full of excitement, grand ideals, and drama—it’s your job as GM to make the PCs’ stories so awe- some, so interesting, that everyone gets excited about the story you are telling together!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Play to find out what happens</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the big reasons to play this game is to discover the story as you play. Even when you’re the GM, you don’t know what will happen, and you can be just as delightfully surprised as anyone at the table! The dice produce surprising results—someone misses when everyone expected them to score a full hit, or vice versa!—that can send the story into sprawling new directions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s also always fun to see what the other great people in your game invent, how they react to the world, and what wacky she- nanigans they come up with. Regardless of how much you plan, players will always surprise you. Embrace this! Roll with the punches when the dice or the other players throw unexpected elements at you, and use the agendas, baselines, guidelines, and GM moves to respond.</p>

<a href="part119.htm#bookmark222" class="s22">This game’s emphasis on surprises and spontaneous play also means that overplanning wastes time and can bog down your ability to run the game. PCs may never visit the bathhouse you carefully mapped, or the bazaar you sketched in loving detail, or the mansion you bedecked with lore-revealing paintings. Except for when game rules are concerned (and a section below teaches you how to stat out NPCs), it’s usually more helpful to prepare broadly, with flexibility in mind. The adventure in this book on page 267</a> is a good example—while it provides details that you might never interact with, it’s also designed broadly enough that it holds together if the PCs don’t go to the</p>
