<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playing a Fire Nation Character</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players who create Fire Nation PCs in this era encounter a unique problem—the Fire Nation and its armies are a dangerous threat to the world. How can a player create a heroic PC from a nation led by such an unbalanced regime?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NO NATION IS A MONOLITH</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">First, keep in mind that the Fire Nation consists of people with different desires, drives, and beliefs. Some of those people are truly dangerous, like the Fire Lord and his daughter. But most of those people aren’t monsters—some aren’t even aware of their nation’s true crimes! Others are trying to stop the war, whether through rebellion or diplomacy. For every Fire Nation zealot, committed en- tirely to Ozai’s purposes, there is a Fire Nation hero, ready to stand against their own nation to protect others.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players looking to play Fire Nation characters should always emphasize this diversity. Just because the Fire Nation military and elites are pursuing the Hundred Year War doesn’t mean that every Fire Nation citizen is on board. Rebels, freedom fighters, peace advocates, conscientious objectors, and more are all great options for Fire Nation characters in this era.</p>

<p class="s38" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DISCOVERY AS AN ARC</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Fire Nation PCs in the Hundred Year War Era, the discovery</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">of the extent of the Fire Nation’s crimes creates a compelling arc. <i>Av- atar Legends </i>heroes are always good people at heart; a PC from the Fire Nation who comes to see all the harm the Fire Nation has done and continues to do must confront that pain.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Fire Nation PC might encounter the truth in the inciting incident</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">of your game, coming to realize the truth of the Fire Nation’s cruel pol- icies as they encounter new perspectives and make new friends. This discovery sets up an arc for the PC in which they must grapple with their relationship to their home culture. But don’t create a PC who doesn’t already understand the Fire Nation’s crimes. Discovering the truth in the inciting incident is fine; discovering the truth during play means the PC might not find a path forward as a hero.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s38" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">REDEMPTION AS AN ARC</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Fire Nation PCs in the Hundred Year War Era might also aim for redemption arcs in which they were somewhat complicit in their nation’s crimes. A discovery arc is easier; a character who didn’t realize their mistake, but immediately sets out to correct it is one that’s easily recognizable as a hero. A character who instead partic- ipated in the terrible behavior, but now seeks to make up for it, is likely a character with a long road to travel.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part11.htm#bookmark10" class="s25">For any player interested in playing a PC on such a redemptive arc, make sure that the crimes of your PC are not irredeemably hei- nous, and that the other players are comfortable with the story you are establishing (see Safety Tools on page </a>12 for more on how</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">you can check in with the other players).</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Much like with an arc of discovery, any PC on an arc of redemption should already be on that arc at the start of play. If the character hasn’t yet come to realize how wrong they were, and still defends their actions, they aren’t ready to be a heroic PC yet.</p>
