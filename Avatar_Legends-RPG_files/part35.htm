</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Korra Era specifically details the state of the world imme- diately after the end of the <i>Ruins of the Empire </i>comic trilogy. The world has undergone significant changes since the previous era, including the creation of <span class="s20">Republic City</span>. This metropolis is the heart of the <span class="s20">United Republic of Nations</span>, a sovereign state where people from all nations live and work together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s a time of great technological advancement, with the citizens of Republic City taking a particular interest in industrial endeavors and cultural innovation. Bending is now a sporting event beloved by the public, and many question whether bending is necessary</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as technology continues to evolve. Vehicles fill the streets, smoke plumes from factories, and benders and non-benders alike travel the skies in airships.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For the first time in history, the two <span class="s20">Water Tribes </span>
<a href="part13.htm#bookmark23" class="s22">are now truly independent from one another. Both survived a civil war that ended with the Southern Water Tribe finally gaining a long-desired independence from the North. And for the first time in ten thousand years, humans and spirits have free access to each other’s worlds thanks to Avatar Korra. She opened the spirit portals at both poles, during the Harmonic Convergence after defeating the chaos spirit, Vaatu (page 16),</a> who tried to plunge the world into darkness. Later, an additional portal was created in Republic City.</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Airbenders <a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">have also returned to the world! Due to Harmonic Convergence (page 80),</a>
<span class="p"> various people from every walk of life and in every nation have spontaneously gained airbending powers. Aang’s son, Tenzin, works with his family to teach these new Air- benders to master their abilities and to embrace Air Nomad cul- ture, as he continues his father’s dream to rebuild the </span>Air Nation<span class="p">.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, the <span class="s20">Earth Kingdom </span>cycles through leaders, from the tyrannical Queen Hou-Ting, to the militaristic dictator-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ship of the metalbending Kuvira, and finally to the young King Wu who hopes to transition the kingdom into a democracy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through these transitions of leadership, there were two attempts to forcefully unite the various provinces of the kingdom into</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">an Earth Empire, but Avatar Korra and her allies stopped both. Kuvira, the first leader of the failed Earth Empire, has now stood trial and pleaded guilty for her war crimes. The Avatar and many others believe that she is truly remorseful for her actions, but the damage and pain she caused runs deep both in the Earth Kingdom and the United Republic of Nations.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s20">Fire Nation </span>remains relatively peaceful during this era. Having learned hard lessons from the past, Fire Lord Izumi is a wise and thoughtful leader who is determined to work with the other nations, instead of conquering them. Within the Fire Nation itself, Izumi and her people focus on developing their cultural identity beyond imperialism, embracing the new won- ders this beautiful future has to offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a more disturbing note, extremist groups such as the Red Lotus reawaken to shape the world according to their twisted ideals. Political upheaval is a constant in this era, with the Earth Kingdom, United Republic of Nations, and Water Tribes experi- encing their own crises. After so much turmoil, it feels as though the entire world is holding its breath as it waits for the next crisis.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Korra</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Korra was born and raised in the Southern Water Tribe, but has spent much of her career as the Avatar in Republic City. Unlike other Avatars before her, Korra contends with an age unlike any other, one in which people don’t revere the Avatar as they used to. Modern technology means the Avatar is watched like never before and her actions are scrutinized by the press.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, if there is anyone who can handle this, it’s Korra; with a tenacious will to perform her duties, she thrives where others might have failed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Korra can be stubborn and quick to jump into a fight, but her determination has enabled her to accomplish things no other Avatar has, such as being the first Avatar who can metalbend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the Red Lotus terrorists broke out of their prison, they poisoned Korra with mercury, but she survived the assassina- tion attempt, though she spent three years recovering from the physical and emotional trauma.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">Korra can no longer connect with her past lives after being temporarily separated from Raava, the spirit that makes up part of the Avatar Spirit during the Harmonic Convergence (page 80).</a> Luckily, the Avatar Spirit continues to live on and so will the Avatar line, but as far as Korra knows her connection to her past incarnations is permanently severed. Even so, Korra is a highly capable Avatar and has dealt with crisis after crisis with tenacity and courage. Her Team Avatar includes Bolin, Mako, her polar bear-dog Naga, and her girlfriend Asami.</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Extremism Born of Fear</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark62" class="s25">Every crisis in this era has its roots in extremist movements and fascist regimes. Non-benders fear being oppressed by benders, while benders fear being made obsolete by fast-advancing tech- nology. These fears led to the bending supremacist movement in the prior era (page </a>70) and the anti-bending movement</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">in this one. The Earth Empire’s success, however fleeting, gave people a taste of a fascist dictatorship. Extremist movements have a way of inspiring more extremist movements, so it is essential to stay alert, wary, and critical of any seeds of intoler- ance and bigotry being planted.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Advance an opposing polarizing standpoint</p>

</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Redemption</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The world isn’t black and white; it’s a vibrant tapestry balancing the tones and hues of impulse and action. Sometimes a person can spin out of balance, embracing chaos or extremist ideas, but striving to find balance again isn’t beyond anyone’s grasp. People who forced their ideals on others, violently or otherwise, may realize they need to make reparations to those harmed along the way. Cruel, violent, or stupid actions all have a cost, but everyone can strive to regain inner balance.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Take the wrong path with the “right” intentions</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">With so many leaders proving to be corrupt, good ones are more valuable than ever. Republic City, the Earth Kingdom, and both Water Tribes have all seen new leaders rise to power, amidst a growing feeling throughout the world that it is time to replace what doesn’t work. After so much disappointment,</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">people have high expectations of their leaders, and it is easy for leaders to become overwhelmed with their people’s conflicting needs, values, and philosophies. New leaders quickly learn it is impossible to please everyone.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Rebel against unjust regulations</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Ruthlessly interrogate leadership, even if it’s just</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Present impossible promises from people in power</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Setting Boundaries</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">People everywhere set and negotiate their boundaries to ensure independence. Humans and spirits struggle to live alongside each other, with no easy solutions to achieving balance. The United Republic of Nations struggled with the short-lived Earth Empire and its determination to reclaim Republic City for itself. Even Ba Sing Se contends with unprecedented change after the wall separating the Lower and Middle Rings fell. As the bound- aries between cultures, peoples, and territories shift, people may find that they want to see change in the boundaries within their personal lives as well.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Set a surprising boundary</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Obstinately oppose changes from positions of power</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Industrialization vs. Tradition</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Technology can now accomplish or surpass feats of bending, which some view as a threat and others as a blessing. Inventors embrace this new technology and see how far they can push their art in the name of science, sometimes to devastating results and sometimes to miraculous discoveries. Republic City is full of skyscrapers, automobiles, factories, power plants, airships, and there will be more technological changes going forward. A few other regions try to hold onto their old ways, but the desire for technology and industry is contagious. The world is full of inevitable disagreements about whether these changes are for the better.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">• Show technology overcoming bending in surprising or dangerous ways</p>
<p class="s28" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">• Destroy or attack new, misunderstood technology</p>

<a name="bookmark68">Important Events</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is a list of important events, which occur leading up to and during this era. Each event has a list of the current consequences for the stories you craft in this era.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Anti-Bending Revolution</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A masked figure called Amon led the anti-bending revolution in Republic City, gaining influence thanks to his mysterious ability to take away people’s bending. In truth, Amon was a Waterbend- er, though he lied and claimed that he was a non-bender whose family was murdered by a Firebender. His followers called themselves <span class="s20">Equalists</span>, and they were eager to see Amon strip all benders of their abilities, a feat he accomplished through blood- bending—he even managed to take away Avatar Korra’s bending for a time. The revolution came to an end when Amon’s identity as a bender was revealed and its other leader, Hiroshi Sato, was imprisoned. Even now, years later, there are still Equalists at large, both violent and non-violent, and enemies might try to manipulate them into attacking the Avatar or other foes.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Equalists are still a threat.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• There is a tension between benders and non-benders in the world, in part due to new technology.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Some benders are hypervigilant in identifying and persecuting Equalists.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Water Tribe Civil War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tensions between the two Water Tribes finally came to a head in this era, leading to a civil war between Southern Water Tribe rebels and the governing Northern Water Tribe. Unalaq, the Chief of the Northern Water Tribe and Korra’s uncle, instigated the crisis. He saw the Southern Water Tribe as an inferior civili- zation that had lost its connection to the spirits and true Water Tribe culture. His proposed solution was for the North to rule over the South.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the height of the Civil War, Unalaq had troops stationed in the Southern Water Tribe and pushed the rebels out of the area. He badly injured his brother Tonraq and imprisoned him for standing against him. The war ended when Avatar Korra defeat- ed Unalaq and the Southern Water Tribe gained independence.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Southern Tribe and Northern Tribe are independent.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Unalaq’s children, Desna and Eska, now rule the Northern Water Tribe.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The South thrives in comparison to earlier eras, balancing an embrace of the new with respect for tradition.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Harmonic Convergence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once every ten thousand years, the planets align, amplifying spiritual energy worldwide. This rare event played a crucial role in Unalaq’s plans. During the most recent Harmonic Conver- gence, Unalaq merged with the chaos spirit Vaatu to create a Dark Avatar, a powerful being capable of great feats of bending and destruction. A battle ensued between Avatar Korra and the Dark Avatar in Republic City’s bay, and though it was a close call and the Avatar Spirit Raava was seemingly destroyed for a time, Korra was victorious. Afterwards, she chose to keep the spirit portals open so that spirits and humans could once more live together and learn from each other for the first time in ten thousand years. This decision radically changed the world,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part14.htm#bookmark24" class="s22">and some people like Raiko, the president of Republic City at the time, thought the shift dangerously disruptive. Also, after Harmonic Convergence, many non-benders across the world suddenly gained airbending abilities. You can read more about the Harmonic Convergence and Vaatu on page 17.</a>
</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The spirit portals in both poles remain open.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Vaatu’s spirit is dissipated.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Avatar Korra no longer has access to her past lives;</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Avatar cycle has restarted with her as the originator.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Red Lotus</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part20.htm#bookmark34" class="s22">The Red Lotus splintered off from the Order of the White Lotus (page 30)</a> shortly after the conclusion of the Hundred Year War. They sought to destroy the world’s governments and any remaining separation between spirits and humans. When Avatar Korra was just a child two young members of the group, Unalaq and Zaheer, hoped to achieve this goal by kidnapping Avatar Korra and indoctrinating her, though this kidnapping failed. Instead, all four attempted kidnappers were imprisoned in separate facilities, and Unalaq (who had only helped plan the kidnapping) broke ties with the Red Lotus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the Red Lotus’ leader, Zaheer, suddenly gained airbending abilities after the Harmonic Convergence, he broke out of prison and helped his three co-conspirators escape their prisons as well. Zaheer assassinated the Earth Queen Hou-Ting, and a lavabending member of the group named Ghazan brought down the wall between the Lower and Middle Rings of Ba Sing Se. The group then managed to capture the Avatar and very nearly succeeded in killing her while she was in the Avatar State. Though the Red Lotus was defeated, their actions have left a lasting mark on the world.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Earth King Wu now governs the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Zaheer is imprisoned in an underground facility.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Other members of the Red Lotus may still be at large.</p>

<a name="bookmark69">Rise of the Earth Empire</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the Red Lotus terrorists assassinated the Earth Queen, the Earth Kingdom fell to chaos. Citizens tired of the crown’s abuse of power did not want to see the kingdom return to old ways, and bandits took advantage of the disruption to target vulner- able villages. Kuvira, a military leader and master Earthbender trained in metalbending by Suyin Beifong, capitalized on the situation by working to stabilize Ba Sing Se. For this she was rewarded with the position of Earth Kingdom provisional leader, a position she began to abuse by enslaving villages to a massive war effort under the guise of reuniting all the Kingdom’s states.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the time came for her to cede power to King Wu, she instead proclaimed the monarchy dissolved, established the Earth Empire, and then launched an invasion of the United Re- public of Nations to reclaim the land it was on. Kuvira’s ambition became her downfall, as she nearly died due to her own spirit energy cannon which created a new spirit portal in Republic City. Korra saved her, and Kuvira subsequently surrendered when she realized the Avatar outmatched her.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Gaoling Crisis</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After Korra and her allies defeated Kuvira, there was a second attempt at replacing the Earth Kingdom with the Earth Empire. Commander Guan, who was the head of the Earth Empire’s southern forces when Kuvira was in charge, led this uprising.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Improving upon brainwashing techniques used decades ago by Long Feng and the Dai Li, Guan used technologically enhanced mind control to gain supporters and undermine the democratic elections established by King Wu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though Guan’s uprising ultimately ended with defeat, it served as proof that there is still much division in the Earth Kingdom. Now that the Earth Empire has dissolved, King Wu still rules the Earth Kingdom. He wishes to guide the Earth Kingdom into a democracy but has decided to do so slowly since not all of his citizens were ready for a big change.</p>

<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Guan is imprisoned, but some of his brainwashing technologies are unaccounted for and may be developed into new forms for which there is no cure.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The poorest villages of the Earth Kingdom are economically devastated by the manipulations of two failed Earth Empires.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Republic City has grown substantially in only a matter of decades, making it one of the most important economic and cul- tural hubs in the world. The city started off as Cranefish Town</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the Earth Kingdom and became a metropolis as more people desired to live in a multicultural environment. Now, Republic City hosts the pro-bending championship, companies like Cab- bage Corp and Future Industries, inventors, industrialists, and Air Temple Island, which serves as a home for Tenzin’s family as well as a haven of Air Nomad culture.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark69" class="s22">Republic City is also home to a new spirit portal. Kuvira created the portal by accident when she lost control of a spirit energy cannon (page 81).</a> This portal became the source of much conflict in the city, with spirits and humans fighting over the territory. Wonyong Keum, the CEO of Keum Enterprises, wanted to build an amusement park around the portal, complete with guided tours into the Spirit World, and went so far as to hire the Triple Threat Triad to secure the area. After that plan backfired and led to the Triple Threats turning against him, he eventually signed a contract giving the lands to the Air Nomads who now protect the portal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The newly elected president of the United Republic of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nations is Zhu Li Moon. President Moon won the election after working tirelessly to help the people living in the temporary evacuee camp after the Earth Empire invasion. As for law en- forcement, the United Republic of Nations has its own military, the United Forces, and a police force with an elite squad of Earthbenders, all trained in metalbending and equipped with metal wire reels and metal armor.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The hardworking President of the United Republic of Nations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zhu Li, the current president of the United Republic of Nations, recently won the election over former president Raiko. She is a selfless, compassionate, and considerate leader who genuinely cares about the well-being of the people of the United Republic of Nations. During Kuvira’s uprising, Zhu Li joined the Avatar in the fight against the Earth Empire and personally tried to sabotage the spirit energy cannon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part36.htm#bookmark71" class="s22">Recently, Zhu Li married her former boss, Varrick (page 84),</a> a successful businessman with flexible morals. Because Zhu Li prioritizes the citizens she governs over all else, she sometimes forgets to take care of herself. Heroes who help pre- serve Zhu Li’s precious time and energy by taking on Republic City’s problems themselves are sure to win the president’s good will. If there seems to be more depth to an issue in the city than meets the eye, chances are heroes can find the beginnings of an answer from Zhu Li.</p>

<a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">Asami Sato runs Future Industries, a company based in Republic City that creates cutting-edge technology, vehicles, and industri- al equipment. The company, founded by Hiroshi Sato, Asami’s father, was passed on to Asami when he was apprehended as a co-leader of the Equalist movement (page 80).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Asami has been friends with Korra since she first came to Republic City, and the two officially started a romantic relation- ship after defeating Kuvira. Those who target Asami’s loved ones better know what they’re doing, as Asami is a skilled engineer, strategist, and martial artist. She’s also clever enough to put her extensive connections and resources to good use. Heroes in need of advanced technology or vehicles might turn to Asami for help. Non-benders in particular could find her a useful ally, since she has numerous tricks up her sleeve for facing a master bender.</p>

<a href="part37.htm#bookmark72" class="s22">Lin Beifong is the Chief of Police in Republic City and the daughter of the legendary Toph Beifong (page 86).</a> Like the other officers in her metalbending police force, she uses</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">metalbending to apprehend criminals and wreck large metal structures, including vehicles, when necessary. Rough around the edges and abrasive, Lin generally chooses to do things by the book with little flexibility.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">She also has a strong moral compass. Lin devotes herself to keeping innocent people safe and aiding the Avatar during the times when their moral compasses align…and sometimes even when they don’t. She is a strong ally and a terrifying enemy due to her relentless personality. Heroes contending with criminal activity might turn to Lin for help or advice. Otherwise, Lin might ask heroes to work for her undercover in order to learn about a triad’s or an extremist group’s inner workings.</p>
