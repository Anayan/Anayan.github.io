<p class="s12" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Summary</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions are at the Flying Koi Carnival in Ba Sing Se, a colorful delight for the eyes tucked away in the prosperous Middle Ring. A day of fun and games is derailed by an Earth Kingdom official—Detective Ziming—and a worried mother named Lei, who explain to PCs that Lei’s daughter, Rose, has</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disappeared. The adventure assumes the players have agreed to help find Rose—she was last seen at the Flying Koi Carnival, and both Ziming and Lei agree that something nefarious must be happening if Rose has vanished.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Unbeknownst to her mother, Rose has been planning to run away with her secret girlfriend, a gangster named Hua! Now, the defiant daughter has found herself in the midst of a crime syndi- cates’ territory war. She may need help from the players if she’s going to escape…assuming the kidnapping isn’t just a clever ploy to finally get away from her family!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This adventure doesn’t establish who kidnapped Rose; tailor the mystery to your player’s actions and <i>
<b>play to find out what happens </b>
</i>
<a href="part92.htm#bookmark183" class="s22">(page 224).</a> There are a number of possible suspects, all with good motivation for the kidnapping! It’s up to you and your group to discover the truth as you play, reacting to the play- ers’ choices while following the threads of the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To help you scatter clues wherever your players wander, “The Mystery” includes potential clues listed with the potential kid- nappers. “Solving the Mystery” provides advice on how to guide players through this adventure; all of the potential kidnappers are given stats and backstories in “Important Characters &amp; Groups.”</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Mystery</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: center;">As the players investigate, many different possibilities for who might’ve kidnapped Rose present themselves. It’s your job to weave them together in interesting ways and present new infor- mation that drives the story forward or takes it in an unexpected (and fun) direction. Providing a backdrop to the kidnapping are a number of different factions, each with their own motivations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Unbeknownst to everyone, Rose and her girlfriend <span class="s20">Hua </span>have plans of running away together. The latter is a gang member, and the former is bright, bold, and not the unwitting victim she might seem. Rose and Hua want a quiet life together in the country, where Hua will no longer have to work as second-in-command in the <span class="s20">Paper Lantern Gang </span>and Rose won’t be discriminated against for her mixed Fire/Earth heritage. If they choose to arrange a “kid- napping” themselves, they’re poised to use all the moving pieces mentioned here to escape the walls of Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, given where Rose went missing, <span class="s20">Ringmaster Peng </span>and the members of the <span class="s20">Flying Koi Carnival </span>are prime suspects, as the circus is a front for a band of thieves in disguise. In the name of equality, they steal from the rich of the Middle Ring to feed the poor of the Lower Ring, executing increasingly bold grifts. They might go so far as to kidnap and ransom the daughter of a wealthy family…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But it just so happens the Flying Koi are in the territory of the violent Paper Lantern Gang, whose reputation is at stake—the Flying Koi Carnival moved in a few months ago and refused to pay the gang the respect and dues they’re owed, despite the carni- val conducting criminal business on the gang’s turf. Gang Leader <span class="s20">Cong </span>is desperate to assert his power—so desperate that he might be willing to frame the Flying Koi Carnival for a kidnapping…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">However, both groups have been under the watchful eye of young <span class="s20">Detective Ziming</span>, who’s just as motivated as Cong to prove herself and earn the respect of a Middle Ring police force that doubts her credentials and cunning. Ziming is so desperate that she might stage a kidnapping just so she can come to the rescue…</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Is Rose the kidnapper?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rose is headstrong and might not be the kidnapped “victim” at all, but the mastermind behind the entire plot, “kidnapping”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">herself by plotting directly with Hua to frame Cong for the crime and allowing the couple to escape Ba Sing Se. This outcome might be appropriate if the players explore greater Ba Sing Se and/or Rose’s house or discover Rose and Hua’s secret romance. If the players discover Rose “kidnapped” herself, perhaps she convinces them to hinder the investigation and help her and Hua to free themselves of Cong. The PCs might even plant their own clues for Detective Ziming to discover…</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">example clues</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Love letters to Hua hidden in Rose’s house or the Paper Lantern Gang headquarters</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A ransom note framing Cong, waiting for the right moment to be delivered</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Rose herself, poorly disguised and seen moving freely in Ba Sing Se crowds</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Is Peng the kidnapper?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ringmaster Peng’s thefts and cons grow increasingly bold. As part of his latest plan, Flying Koi Carnival performers may have kidnapped Rose, the daughter of a rich diplomat, to extort money from her mother. This would be the most extreme measure yet, and some workers close to Peng are uncomfortable with the idea. Could there be internal conflict brewing at the Flying Koi? This outcome might be appropriate if players investigate the carnival in-depth or lean on the performers to share what they know.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">example clues</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Information about Rose and her family in the ringmaster’s tent</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Stolen art in Maolo’s tent, pointing to a criminal enterprise</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• A mysterious ransom note that smells of popcorn</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Is Cong the kidnapper?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cong needs to get rid of the Flying Koi Carnival and fast. Their refusal to pay their dues is an embarrassment to the Paper Lan- tern Gang! At Hua’s suggestion, Cong may have kidnapped Rose from the Flying Koi Carnival in an effort to pin the crime on the circus and have them removed from Cong’s territory. With Hua behind the plan, things could all go sideways, and Cong could end up getting blamed instead, freeing Hua from his control.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This outcome might be appropriate if players explore Ba Sing Se’s Middle Ring outside the carnival or find the Paper Lantern Gang’s headquarters.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">example clues</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Witness accounts of a body dragged into the Paper Lantern Gang headquarters in the middle of the night</p>

<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part124.htm#bookmark228" class="s22">Ziming is desperate to earn respect within the Ba Sing Se police force. Her pride may have driven her to extremes: perhaps she hired her informant Ibuki (see page 275)</a> to kidnap Rose so</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that Ziming can “rescue” the girl from her abductors, pinning the crime on either the Flying Koi or the Paper Lantern Gang. This outcome might be appropriate if players explore Ba Sing Se’s black market or city politics at large.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">example clues</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• A ransom note, with handwriting that matches Ziming’s</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Hints to the PCs from Ibuki that he has information… for a price</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These suggestions for who kidnapped Rose aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Mix and match whatever works best and makes the most exciting game for the game you’re running for your players. Perhaps Ziming set things up, but Rose and Hua are making the most of the situation to finally run off together!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Solving the Mystery</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the players are introduced to the kidnapping by Detective Ziming and Lei (detailed in “Introduction”) your players may or may not have an idea of what they want to investigate first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although you want to tailor this adventure to the players and their interests, <span class="s20">start with an idea of what outcome you find exciting. </span>This will help you determine what to present to your players first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Perhaps you feel really strongly about Rose and Hua’s empowerment as the true masterminds. Or perhaps you’re intrigued by the political dynamic between the Paper Lantern Gang and the Flying Koi Carnival. Determine what story would be the most fun for you to play or which you think you can present most dynamically. This is your starting point, an idea of what clues to offer, especially if your PCs are interested in the investigation but not sure where to begin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But don’t offer concrete evidence yet. Let the players tell you how they conduct the investigation. Maybe they skip the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">carnival entirely and venture across the vast metropolitan that is Ba Sing Se to learn more about Rose’s home life. If so, you can’t anchor the clues about Rose’s kidnapping to the Flying Koi’s location; pivot to the clues (and suspects!) that fit where the episode takes you. <span class="s20">In other words, expect to adjust your idea of the adventure depending on the aspects of the story that most interest your players.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The key is to encourage conversation and theorizing among the players and to listen carefully. If players are very excited about their own complicated theory behind the kidnapping or if they latch onto a particular location or character, drop clues to lead them further in that direction. Avatarverse heroes tend to end up where they are needed; let your players feel clever! Your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">goal is to create an interesting adventure regardless of where that adventure takes the players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Although you want to facilitate that satisfying “We solved it!” feeling for your players, you don’t want the adventure to feel too easy. Part of feeling clever is feeling like you solved a tricky puz- zle. Sometimes players will have different theories at the table, and maintaining more than one possibility until the very end,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or creatively combining their theories, is one way to maintain the element of surprise. If the path gets too straightforward, you need to introduce complications to keep the tension high.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you or your players are unsure what to do next, <a href="part122.htm#bookmark225" class="s107">use an escalation (page 272),</a>
<span class="s20"> to add new information to the story and push the scene in an unexpected way. </span>Perhaps Maolo of the Flying Koi Carnival picks the pocket of one of the players, and they have to chase him down; when they catch up with him, he bargains some information he’s heard about the Paper Lanterns kidnapping someone in exchange for the PCs letting him go. Escalations allow you to push the story in different ways when things get stale and help players successfully contin- ue their investigation simply by being interested in the world around them.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How does this adventure end?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eventually, the accumulation of clues—and the players’ focus— will push the group toward one suspect or another; it’s your job as a GM to continue unfolding the story in new and interesting ways. Don’t thwart the players or undermine what’s been estab- lished, but keep the factions and characters moving in ways that make the story memorable and interesting. In other words, keep the story moving without undermining anything you’ve already said is true!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, if the companions become convinced the Paper Lanterns are trying to pin the kidnapping on the carnival, they may head to the Paper Lantern’s hideout to free Rose and hand the bad guys over to Ziming. If you still have time to continue playing, you could throw in another twist using the information you know about Rose: maybe Hua convinced Cong to kidnap Rose, but while the gang is busy fighting the companions, the lovers sneak off! Not only do the companions have to fight their way through the Paper Lanterns, they also have to catch up with Hua and Rose, trailing them through the city streets while they try to figure out why Rose wasn’t excited to be rescued!</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The end of this adventure is largely up to the players and</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">what they want to do<span class="p">, but it most likely has something to do with Rose—the PCs may confront Peng in the big top just as he plans to ransom Rose back to her mother or just miss catching Rose as she rides off into the sunset with Hua laughing on the back of an ostrich-horse after they defeat Cong. It’s rare for the players to go through this adventure and not have to confront Rose and what she wants by the end of it.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Think of the end of your adventure like the end of an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>—you intro- duced the players to the issue, there’s some action, a big confron- tation, and then the result of the confrontation—that’s how the adventure concludes. If you’re running out of time, move the players to a big scene that wraps up the story, like Rose and Hua mounting a grand escape that leads to a chase through the streets or the Flying Koi Carnival trying to hide Rose as they pack up everything in the middle of the night to get out of Ba Sing Se!</p>
