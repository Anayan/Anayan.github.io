</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some campaigns last more than just a few sessions, long enough for the group’s adventures to become a story unto themselves. Most of the existing stories in the Avatarverse are this long-form storytelling, consecutive adventures that feature recurring antag- onists and allies that follow a larger structure for the whole story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These longer campaigns can be broken down into <span class="s20">seasons</span>, longer arcs that cross sessions to bring multiple adventures into the same structure. A season might be explicitly centered on completely resolving the group’s focus—defeating a villain once and for all!—but you may discover that the real aim of the season is a bit different than what it appeared on the surface, which allows multiple seasons to add up to a larger story. In <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, for example, each season has a focus on a new, unique antagonist who poses some dire threat. But in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, even though it might appear that Aang’s sole focus for the entire series is defeating Fire Lord Ozai, the real focus of each season is revealed to be something different—<i>”Book One: Water” </i>is about Aang finding a waterbending teacher, for example—until the finale of <i>“Book Three: Fire,” </i>when he confronts Ozai.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In many ways, seasons are a natural outcome of playing multiple sessions with the same group across many adventures: your PCs will grow and change, the world will respond with new threats and challenges, and eventually you’ll want to wrap it up with a big, heroic ending. But crafting an awesome tale across many connected stories is challenging! Here are some of the ele- ments you should consider as you undertake a longer campaign.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Reinforcing the Focus &amp; Scope</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the greatest challenges of long-form roleplaying is ensur- ing that the tales you tell feel like an ongoing story each time you play. In <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, the group focus and scope are your primary tools for building something that feels more like a season than a random collection of episodes set in the Avatarverse!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The group focus is a key tool because it’s an agreed-upon motivation for the story you’re telling together. If your group has decided they want to protect a place from harm, then a good</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">number of your episodes should allow them to bring that focus to bear, identifying threats to the place and figuring out the best way to address those threats while exploring their own role as heroes. If you ever feel like you’re not sure where the story is going, return to that group focus and ask if you’ve given the PCs enough time to engage the issues they said they wanted to focus on at the start!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The scope of your story is thus equally important; the group focus might motivate action, but the scope tells you what larger frame keeps the story grounded. If your group wants the scope to focus around a Fire Sage temple, then the politics and drama of that temple are a great source of drama, week after week after week; if they’ve decided they want to see the whole world, then you’ve got a clear picture of how varied things should be each time you play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part110.htm#bookmark203" class="s22">Obviously, both the focus and the scope of your story can change—often in a season finale (page </a>254)—but you can always return to them as anchors that ground your narrative over time.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Episodic Structures</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As your season develops, one of your biggest responsibilities is structuring the episodes over many sessions. The group’s scope and focus help you to figure out what to do session to session, but you also need to think about how the whole story feels adventure to adventure.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Itinerant vs. Stable Adventures</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Campaigns of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>can vary be- tween <span class="s20">itinerant adventures</span>, in which the PCs roam from place to place, exploring a larger area, and <span class="s20">stable adventures</span>, in which the PCs stay largely based in a particular place and don’t roam at large. Both are wonderful frames for adventures across the Four Na- tions, but they require different preparation from you as the GM.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Stories that default to itinerant adventure, like moving from town to town across the Fire Nation or joining the new Air Nation in dealing with whatever new problem arises, require the most preparation. Generally speaking, you need to prepare a full adventure for itinerant companions to ensure that you’re ready to keep things interesting for your players. It’s usually the case that the end of an adventure leads the PCs to leave this place and journey to the next one…which means you need to have a new set of conflicts ready to go. You can’t be confident that the next session simply picks up with the consequences of the last—as the PCs move on, so too does the story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’ve chosen a very narrow scope that keeps your PCs in one defined location, on the other hand, you may find prepared adventures much less useful; there’s no point in adding on a whole new set of characters and conflicts if the events of the last episode have created a whole new series of issues for the companions to address. In fact, the best way to prepare for each session might instead be to review everything that happened in the last session and build on whatever consequences naturally</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">arise. If the companions are based in Ba Sing Se, and last session they made a mess fighting off a group of armed thugs, then it’s natural the Dai Li comes calling…</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Primary vs. Secondary Adventures</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Regardless of what kind of overall structure you choose for your campaign, think also about <span class="s20">primary adventures</span>—those dealing with the group focus and the major plot threads of your story— and <span class="s20">secondary adventures </span>that give everyone a break from the main conflict to investigate a crime, find a new mentor, or go to the beach! These secondary adventures can be a great way to spread around the spotlight as well; if you find that one or two PCs seem to be the main focus of the primary adventures, focus a secondary adventure on one of the others!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can also offer multiple levels of action within an adven- ture as well; the companions don’t have to stick together at all times! If two of the politically-focused characters decide to take their case directly to the United Republic Council, the rest of the companions might have enough time on their hands to track down that swordsmaster they heard about a few sessions ago.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spread the spotlight around as often as you can, making sure that your season features the whole ensemble cast.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Character Arcs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Player characters in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>are al- ways growing and changing, looking at problems differently and trying on new ways of thinking as they struggle to find balance. Over the course of a season, however, you can see that struggle resolve, each player answering the important questions their playbook asks about their character’s identity.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Balance Shifts</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each PC’s balance is the core of their story, the primary issue that the character has to confront along their adventures; all the action and challenges they find in the Four Nations only matters insofar as those adventures help them decide what kind</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of person they truly are. Their balance thus reflects their current progress on their journey, shifting back and forth until they are so committed to one part of themselves that their center shifts and they must find a new equilibrium.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In this way, you can start to see a PC <span class="s8">losing their balance </span>as fulfilling the peak of their arc, a moment in which their commit- ment to one part of their identity begins to eclipse other parts. Sometimes characters <span class="s8">lose their balance </span>toward alternating principles, keeping their center near the middle of their balance track as they move back and forth, but they are more likely to <span class="s8">lose their balance </span>in the same direction, emphasizing one side of their balance track as they answer the core question each playbook poses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lean into that tension! If the Guardian repeatedly intervenes when she thinks no one else can help, she’s choosing Self-Re- liance and her center will shift toward that principle. Give her allied NPCs who affirm that side of herself, and antagonists who push against that momentum and cause her to question her path. Make the question of her Self-Reliance an important question of the campaign so that her choices are reflected both in how her center shifts and how the season plays out.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Growth and New Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Balance is only one dimension of character growth throughout a season; pay close attention to how often the companions hit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">their growth questions at the end of a session too. In general, the companions should almost always learn something challenging, exciting, or complicated about the world—that’s why you’re playing the game—and they should regularly have opportuni- ties to stop dangerous threats, solve problems, and guide other characters toward balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Their personal growth questions, however, sometimes involve challenging behaviors—like the Prodigy genuinely expressing gratitude to another PC—or activities that require effort and investment, such as the Hammer making progress against their adversary. In these cases, look for opportunities to offer that PC chances for them to pursue that arc and earn that growth. After all, if the adversary is neglected by the Hammer, they will surely take actions on their own that remind the Ham- mer why they are their adversary in the first place!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part85.htm#bookmark167" class="s22">At the same time, don’t neglect to put opportunities for train- ing in front of the companions as well. The PCs have to wrestle internally with their balance, but they also need to have a regular stream of mastery conditions (page 215)</a> to contend with as well. Make sure that your NPCs—even enemies!—express</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">an open willingness to train the PCs…and that their mastery conditions touch on the same issues of balance and growth. For example, a Bold that absolutely refuses to apologize for any- thing—skipping the growth they would otherwise earn each session—might be given a mastery condition that reminds them of the value of apologies; a Rogue who finds themselves on the wrong side of the law pretty much every episode might be given a mastery condition that asks them to assist the authorities in solving an actual crime.</p>
