<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">One major conflict of this era that plays out behind curtains of smoke and fire is the conflict brewing between Fire Lord Sozin and his sister Princess Zeisan. Zeisan follows Air Nomad philosophy and her goal is to dethrone her family, who she believes are evil to the core. Her ac- tions infuriate her brother to no end. However, a deeper story brews beneath the surface.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part27.htm#bookmark47" class="s25">When Zeisan first started her training with the Air Nomad Sister Rioshon (page </a>50), the two women fell in love.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Sadly, Zeisan’s goal to unravel her brother’s plans re- quires a politically motivated marriage to a monk named Khandro rather than a romantic one to Rioshon. So, the two women’s love goes unvoiced; they both understand there are greater things at stake than their own personal happiness. Zeisan and Khandro have a similar understand- ing—both have a lot to gain from marrying one another, and they are working together as allies to take down</p>

<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Roku Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation in this era is generally stable and more or less united. Internal conflicts, like the Camellia-Peony War of the Ky- oshi Era, haven’t stricken the nation for decades, and Fire Lord Sozin’s ascension to the throne was painless and uncontested.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation has spent decades focusing on internal matters, and with a new Fire Lord on the throne, the people have begun to look beyond their borders. As Sozin has stated many times, the Fire Nation has so much to offer the world and it is time they start sharing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation’s burgeoning outward interest is represented in a number of ways. They’re focused on developing faster and better forms of transportation (specifically via coal power) to bring the rest of the world closer than ever. Sozin jump-started his nation’s development of coal-powered vessels and created hundreds of jobs for the poorest members of society, building his great fleet. Materials for the fleet are scarce and the Fire Nation has come into political conflict with the Earth Kingdom on numerous occasions over resources, which Sozin has quietly used to stoke anti-Earth Kingdom sentiment in his nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite any political machinations, scholars and diplomats attempt to open relations with other nations and share mutually beneficial technologies with one another to further Fire Nation knowledge. While the Fire Lord encourages his people to drink deep from the well of knowledge in other nations, within his borders he tries to preserve Fire Nation culture. The largest road- block to this is the younger nobles, many of whom now seek out Air Nomads to guide them on the principles of enlightenment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22">The Air Nomads have gone so far as to build an Air Nomad center of learning within the Fire Nation (page 46)</a> with funds from Fire Nation nobles. As a small offshoot of Air Nomads called the Guiding Wind have caused trouble with the building of the temple, Sozin has sent his military guard to the location to protect the local population—a move hailed with great respect by many of the common folk on the islands who question the Guiding Wind’s motives.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A competent ruler with imperial ambitions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Sozin ascended to the throne, he was eager to make a name for himself. His father, a staunch traditionalist, allowed the Fire Nation’s internal politics to proceed as they had for decades. Sozin struck a more aggressive stance in relation to the Fire Nation nobility. He quashed the remaining internal fighting between families, and now works to secure their loyalty to the crown through political channels. One major roadblock has been some of the nobles’ embrace of Air Nomad ideals, spear- headed by Sozin’s sister Zeisan, which infuriates him to no end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To counteract his sister’s influence, he’s begun nationalistic propaganda campaigns targeting the poorest members of soci-</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ety. He’s generous to those less fortunate and wins people over by providing food, shelter, and work, which are all dependent on his success as Fire Lord. Sozin can be a strong ally, but he’s deeply nationalistic and has his eyes set beyond the Fire Nation. He always conducts himself with intelligence and an odd warmth, but underneath his veneer of decorum is a fiery inferno of unbridled ambition.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Zeisan</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A chi-blocking princess working to undo her family’s corruption <span class="p">Zeisan was born without firebending and spent her childhood pitted against her brother Sozin to prove her worthiness. To survive her family, she devoted herself to Air Nomad training under Sister Rioshon, who taught her many things including chi-blocking. Zeisan shares her brother’s intensity and doubts her own ability to be good, but is focused on dismantling her family’s corruption.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part27.htm#bookmark47" class="s22">During training, Zeisan and Rioshon fell in love, but their pair- ing was not advantageous to Zeisan’s dynasty-toppling ambitions. Instead, she has just announced her intention to marry Khandro of the Guiding Wind (page 50)</a> and wishes to renounce her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">titles and wealth in favor of a spiritual life. Her example is popular enough that other young nobles now vow the same, and Zeisan senses in the Guiding Wind the destabilizing element she needs to undermine her brother. The princess can be a powerful ally to any hero needing political help against the Fire Nation or a boost to escape trouble with Fire Nation nobility.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Oraso Eiko, a decorated military leader, led the united Fire Nation troops in the last real conflict between the clans</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the name of the new Fire Lord Sozin. Thanks to her know- how, she won the battle and the nation finally united under the throne. Now, the general supports the Fire Lord’s internal ini- tiative to build infrastructure and provide jobs to the populace, but questions the expense of a Fire Nation fleet. Why not remain isolated and prosperous? There has to be something more here, but the general is not sure she wants to find out. The general respects anyone coming from a military background and could ask for those heroes’ help when Fire Nation interests are at stake.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kaja is committed to the cause of balance and service of the Avatar. After helping Roku master the Avatar State, he remains a staunch supporter of the Avatar. Internally, Kaja works with his fellow Fire Sages to preserve Fire Nation spirituality and often serves as advisor to the Fire Lord on these matters. Unlike Sozin, Kaja is unworried about the Air Nomads’ influence on Fire Nation nobility. Fads have a way of coming and going among the rich; his focus is on maintaining tradition for future generations. Kaja is concerned with what he sees from his own nation’s subtle moves, but he does not wish to distract the Avatar from import- ant international work. Kaja could ask heroes for help getting to the bottom of the Fire Nation’s international activities or ensur- ing the Avatar’s will is carried out in the Fire Nation.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uzuku Yuyan is an astonishing markswoman. Firing an arrow from a bow is no mere physical act; it is spiritual, requiring perfect harmony between archer and arrow. She transformed her archery into an art form, and many a noble has sponsored her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in exchange for demonstrations and lessons. Now, Uzuku faces pressure to share her incredible skills with the Fire Nation. Some want her as one of the nation’s deadliest agents; others want her to teach new archers her incredible skills. She feels a loyalty to her homeland, but is conflicted—they seek to change her artistic gifts into crass violence. Heroes might find a teacher with her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or they might find an ally if they can convince her to take new action with regard to her homeland.</p>

She has a real hope for connecting the world, believing her ships will unite the nations and lead to greater academic discourse. To that end she’s reached out to fellow inventors from all nations in hopes</p>

It’s much easier for people on the islands to blame the Earth Kingdom for their problems, rather than looking too deeply at what their own nation is (or isn’t) doing for them.

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Zeisan is earnest in her plan to give up her riches and rank for a life of poverty and service, even though such an act would greatly frustrate her family. However, she knows that when Sozin is angry he gets sloppy—maybe she can trick him into revealing his schemes to her. She’s seen Sozin’s avarice first hand and knows it’s only a matter of time until he makes a big move to show off his power. Political backstabbing isn’t in line with the Air Nomad ideals she tries to adhere to…but she’s will- ing to abide this evil if it means she can ultimately do good.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sozin was blindsided by his sister’s relationship with the Guiding Wind’s leader Khandro and nearly couldn’t control his rage when she proposed marriage to the monk. He sees the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guiding Wind’s anti-nobility beliefs as a direct threat to him and is determined to stop her by any means necessary. He’s fought with Zeisan for as long as he can remember and now that he is Fire Lord he refuses to back down.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many members of the nobility now seek a dragon to hunt, kill, and gain legendary firebending abilities from its death. Bolstered by Sozin’s leadership, many see the dragon hunts as a right bequeathed to them by the benevolence of the Fire Lord and their own nobility. The dragon hunts have caused numerous ethical debates between the nobility and spiritual leaders, but the most unexpected result of the hunts has been the imbalance created within the Spirit World.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Spirits seem drawn to the locations where dragons die and strange occurrences abound around those sites. Luckily, most of the deaths have occurred away from populated areas and Sozin has been quick to send his taskforce to clean up any “messes” left by the hunt. However, the imbalance created by the deaths has even drawn a joint envoy from the Water Tribes who sensed the disturbance. The envoy has faced a number of issues when inves- tigating the death sites, most disturbingly a propaganda cam- paign by Sozin, which blames the spiritual activity on <i>their </i>visits rather than the other way around. Many Fire Nation citizens mistrust the tribespeople and refuse to help them investigate, seeing them as nuisances and trouble-makers.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads of the Roku Era are influential and their teach- ings have spread far and wide. Much of this is due to the direct support and involvement of the political families within the Fire Nation. This relationship is being celebrated with the construc- tion of a Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning in the Fire Nation, made possible through the funding and management of Fire Nation nobility. The construction of this center is a divisive issue, and a small school of Air Nomads called the Guiding Wind, led by the popular philosopher Khandro, speaks out against its construc- tion and demands an end to Air Nomad affiliation with any nation’s ruling classes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Guiding Wind is a small order, not officially recognized by</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark43" class="s22">the Four Temples of the Air Nomads. They want autonomy over both their physical and spiritual life and aim to undermine the controlling power of elites. Avatar Roku often calls on the Air No- mads to aid other nations, but the Guiding Wind refuses on the grounds he is overstepping by asking that they involve themselves in politics. In contrast, most Air Nomad temples gladly help when Roku calls, not only in the border dispute between the Earth Kingdom and Northern Water Tribe (page 46),</a> but in natural disasters like the earthquakes in the east of the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Master Youdron continues to support the Air Nomads’ re- lationship with the Avatar and with elites of all nations as a way to help the world and reach more people. The conflict between Youdron’s perspective and that of the upstart Guiding Wind has sparked an internal discourse within the Air Nomads on wheth- er they should turn more inwards as the Guiding Wind suggests, or continue to help the rest of the world where they can. Part of this tension comes from whether or not the Air Nomads should embrace those with lots of worldly prosperity (like the nobility) or reject them and any trappings of wealth altogether, because working with other nations means also working with those unwilling to cede power or wealth.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An elder who opposes the Guiding Wind</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Master Youdron is an elderly airbending monk and an Air No- mad Elder. As a representative of the Air Nomads, he stands in opposition to Khandro and his teachings. Youdron believes the Air Nomads should work with the Avatar and the other nations to reach more people and help the world. He accepts that deal- ing with the elites is a means to that end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Youdron, a cautious man, knows of the danger the Fire Nation poses to his people should they cross the Fire Lord. As a precaution, Youdron has begun transcribing some of their</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">most sacred practices into coded texts and hiding them in places around the Four Nations. Youdron is pulled in many different directions in his old age, and as the Guiding Wind movement gains popularity he could use help in his secret mission.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Khandro</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A devout Air Nomad and popular philosopher</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part27.htm#bookmark45" class="s22">Khandro is the charismatic and ambitious head of the Guiding Wind movement; he argues that the relationship between the Air Nomads and the nobility of the world has impeded the spir- itual growth of people across all nations. Khandro truly believes that the ideals of the Guiding Wind will help him and his people reach spiritual enlightenment and that marrying Zeisan (page 48),</a> the sister of the Fire Lord, will help him destabilize the nobility structures in the Fire Nation. Khandro has an abiding respect for Zeisan and what she is willing to do to unravel the corruption in her country. For their plan to work he must marry the princess—against the advice of his most loyal acolytes—and risk incurring the wrath of the Fire Lord.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Currently, Khandro is recruiting members of the Air Nomad</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temples to his cause. Those who feel they’re being spread too thin or worry about the nobility’s influence have embraced his teachings. Khandro can be a powerful ally to those looking to topple Fire Nation nobility if they can prove they believe in the Guiding Wind’s ideals.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rioshon is a skilled Airbender and chi-blocker from the Western Air Temple, sought the world over for her martial skills. She’s serious, intelligent, and speaks honestly in most situations, even if it means angering people. The nun only teaches students she is absolutely sure will only use the attained knowledge for princi- ples adhering to traditional Air Nomad philosophy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One such student was Princess Zeisan, who Rioshon taught to chi-block. Over the course of their training together, Rioshon and Zeisan fell in love, but never publicly acknowledged it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rioshon has heard rumors that Princess Zeisan’s rejection of her family has angered Fire Lord Sozin. She now worries harm may befall the princess, and she might have to step in to help Zeisan, despite swearing to stay apart in fear that Sozin might discover their love for each other and use it against his sister.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Master Airbender and friend of Avatar Roku</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyatso, a young, friendly, goofy monk of the Southern Air Temple, just became a master Airbender. He’s good friends with Avatar Roku, who often comes to Gyatso for practical advice or for a fresh perspective when he’s feeling dour. Gyatso remains neutral in the conflicts and internal debate about whether the Air Nomads should become more isolationist or continue embracing the world. He believes diversity amongst his people is a good thing and internal debate eventually leads to fruitful progress no matter the decision. To that end, he encourages the temples to discuss and debate one another in the spirit of com- promise. Anyone who wants a level head in disputes can find no finer monk than Gyatso. He manages to effortlessly work levity into difficult situations yet takes everyone’s feelings seriously.</p>

</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A young Air Nomad with a strong bond to sky bison</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sister Norri is a young Air Nomad student who shepherds the sky bison near the Western Air Temple. She’s fun-loving, knows all there is to know about bison, and likes to cause a little bit of chaos for her mentors. Norri’s dedication to the bison has inter- fered many times with her gaining her master tattoos. While she cares for the spiritual teachings of her people, she’s not overly bothered with mastering airbending and is constantly distracted by any number of matters concerning sky bison. Recently, she and her bison companion, Swish, have been tasked with a secret mission by master Youdron to hide sacred Air Nomad artifacts. She’s in over her head, has never been so far from her temple, and could use a bit of help!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anada</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A brilliant engineer adopted by the Air Nomads</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sister Anada is an engineer whose innovative designs created the Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning. Anada was orphaned in the Fire Nation and cared for by her grandmother as a baby, but when her grandmother couldn’t care for a child any longer, she gave her over to be raised by the Air Nomads as a nun.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Anada can’t bend, a rarity in Air Nomad society, but her skills earned her the opportunity to return to the Fire Nation and reunite with her beloved grandmother. She happily accepted that chance, but things aren’t turning out as planned. Work on the center has halted due to the Guiding Wind’s interference and the Fire Nation military guard seizing control of the site. Anada and the other Air Nomads need help untangling this situation before it escalates.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eastern Air Temple</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked themes: Resources and Industrialization</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In order to fund a number of infrastructure advancements in the Earth Kingdom, the eastern states strip-mine the mountains in the region near the Eastern Air Temple. Having little need for the resources, the Air Nomads of the temple did little to stop the miners, until they dug so deep into the mountains they angered a local spirit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The giant spirit, called Stone Dreamer, shaped like a gigantic canyon crawler with hundreds of legs, was a sleepy, peaceful spirit despite its appearance. It slumbered near the Eastern Tem- ple because it enjoyed the quiet, but when the miners disrupted its home—even after being warned by the Air Nomads—it went on a rampage, destroying equipment and threatening towns. The Council of Elders at the Eastern Temple debate whether or not they should step in to help—doesn’t the spirit have a right to protect its home?</p>
