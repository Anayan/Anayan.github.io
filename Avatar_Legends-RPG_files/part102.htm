<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combat exchanges run a little differently than the rest of the game. They’re a little more “crunchy” or rules-focused. However, remember that combat doesn’t occur for combat’s sake. When characters fight, it’s because they feel they must use force to achieve their goals. While force and violence are more common in the Avatarverse, it must still be justified by what the combat- ants want—few people get into a fight just for the heck of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Keep that in mind when running combat exchanges: rare is the NPC who simply participates in exchange after exhausting exchange, ignoring their own wellbeing. If an NPC <i>does </i>do so, it’s because they’re distracting the companions from something more important, or have gone berserk in some way, or feel they need to sacrifice themselves in order to prove a point. More often, NPCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">take different actions after an exchange, taunt or speak to the com- panions, or otherwise attempt to achieve their goal.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Managing spotlight</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Think of an exchange as active contesting combatants trading a bout of blows—not a “round of combat.” This might mean a single punch or a flurry of quick attacks. It may involve bending or might not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If all the companions are in a fight with multiple opponents, it’s a good idea to split exchanges up into groups. You can switch between these groups to provide every player the spotlight, and allow PCs to use techniques to shift from one to the other, or to make moves in between exchanges.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">So as not to focus too much attention on one PC, think carefully before introducing one-on-one duels. These should have a good reason: maybe it’s an Agni Kai and a PC has to prove themselves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe one PC is distracting a major villain while the others evacuate a village. In such cases, make sure the other PCs (who are not fighting) do something meaningful, and shift the spotlight</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">onto them after each exchange. If the other PCs have nothing to do, you should involve them in combat with more foes (henchpeople, minions, or lackeys could arrive at the scene, for instance).</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Crafting tension</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even combat exchanges can get boring if overused. You can keep exchanges interesting by varying the stakes of fights, the environ- ments of fights, and the tactics of fights.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Make sure that not every fight is about who is left standing; few combats should ever be “to the death.” Think about what the combatants want and how fighting helps them get it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Also think about fun scenery for action, and make sure you don’t repeat the same kind of scenery too often. A crowded bazaar, a rickety bridge, a series of stepping stones in a rushing river, and the treetops of a forest all offer different environmental obstacles and opportunities for a fight. Make your NPCs make use of the environ- ment, employ what’s found in it, attack it, and change it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To vary the tactics of fights, don’t have NPCs make the same choice over and over. A clever opponent doesn’t strike over and over. Retreating, advancing, taking hostages, putting things and peo- ple in danger—a fighter might do all these things to gain an edge.</p>
