<p class="s12" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Conversation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you remember playing pretend with your friends as a little kid, the conversation that drives a roleplaying game is kind of like that! You talk about the interesting things your characters do, have adventures, and build on each other’s contributions. You might invent new characters on the spot if you need them, but you might also play the same characters over and over in a continuing story of adventures, one after another.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Playing make-believe wasn’t all in your head; you’d use ac- tion figures to represent your characters, cool sticks as swords or wizard staves, and the features of the jungle gym on your playground as inspiration for your imaginary world. In other words, you’d use tools as springboards for an interesting con- versation, drawing in new ideas to keep your story fresh and the action moving forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In a game like <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, you just use different tools! You have the history of the Four Nations to spark ideas for conflicts, villains, heroes, and more; you have playbooks, which provide support for creating companions; and you have the rules of the game itself, which guide you to surpris- ing, interesting things to say. The tools in this book aren’t limits on your imagination; they are springboards and structures that push you to keep things moving in interesting directions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Regardless of what sparks your imagination, the conversation usually revolves around your characters, the heroes of the story. You say what they do and how they react to the world and other characters. Since the other players don’t live in your head, you also sometimes convey your character’s thoughts, emotions, and feelings to the other players and the GM, like when you say, “My character looks down at the ground, and you can tell what you said really hurt his feelings.”</p>
<p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">There are also times in the conversation when you slip direct- ly into your character’s shoes, no longer narrating but actually taking on their persona. You make the gestures your character makes; you say things your character says. Most people do this without thinking much about it! It’s pretty natural to <i>become </i>your character while you play, to want what they want, to fear the outcome of the dice at crucial moments or to be elated when they win the day. Some of the best moments in a roleplaying game happen when the real world falls away and you experience the importance and meaning of the fictional world firsthand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The conversation in a roleplaying game evolves naturally over the course of the session as you go back and forth between narrating and embodying your character. The rules of the game are all about driving that conversation toward interesting places, but it’s your job as a group to keep the conversation interesting. Grand duels between bending masters! Heroic sacrifices for the greater good! Confrontations with powerful villains! Wherever the fiction takes you…</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Many Sessions, Many Stories</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the best parts about roleplaying is that it’s not limited to a single story written in advance or one path that you have to walk from beginning to end. Instead, you and your friends can create as many stories as you like with the tools in this book,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">both tales featuring the same characters in repeating adventures over the course of many sessions of play or brand-new characters that have adventures in completely different locations and eras.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Roleplaying gives you a chance to spend time with your friends telling stories, providing structure for those conversa- tions and distributing the work of making the story awesome across the whole group. But each story you tell is just one among many—roleplaying gives you the tools to try new things and introduce new ideas together as a team.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The conversation you have through play is a bit like getting to make your own <span class="s10">Avatar Legends </span>show or movie; you get to design the characters, you get to create the conflicts, and you get to say what happens to those characters as they go on adven- tures and learn and grow. All of this—across many sessions of play—comes from you and your friends, your imagination and creativity providing materials alongside the rules in this book to create brand-new stories of the Avatarverse!</p>
