<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While all the rules and advice in this book are designed to support stories in the Avatarverse, there are a few core ideas you need to keep in mind while you play. <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game </span>tells stories of adventure and action against the back- drop of the Avatarverse, a fantasy setting in which any individual person can change the course of history…but no one can escape the decisions of the past.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In other words, the potential for change is infinite—there is always a new challenge to be met, a new future to be built, a new legacy to be forged—but the Avatarverse is a place in which people remember what came before, whether that be</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the great deeds of Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko, the terrible destruction wrought by Fire Lord Sozin, or the innumerable warlords and bandits that lived and died long before Avatar Kyoshi first learned earthbending. The past matters, now more than ever, and the consequences of your actions will echo long after you are gone.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The stories you tell through this game are not stories of the battle between good and evil. Instead, they are stories about how people try to make a better future while dealing with the problems of the past. They are stories about misguided figures who take things too far and heroes who make sacrifices to find compromises and new ways forward in equal measure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part46.htm#bookmark93" class="s22">Your characters in this story are always capable heroes with the training and willpower necessary to make the world a better place. They’re drawn together by events that called them to undertake an important struggle—see Outline the Inciting Incident, page </a>111—but that goal is too large for them to accomplish overnight. Instead, they will have to work together to make a meaningful difference. Sometimes that means they must discover a hidden truth or deep learning; sometimes it means they must win the trust of a worthy ally; and sometimes that means they must defeat a dangerous and powerful foe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each of these goals is complicated by the characters’ own in- ternal struggles, the way they are torn between their principles as they deal with problems. For example, the heroes might finally confront a murderous bandit who has been terrorizing the near- by villages, only to discover the bandit is keeping a community of people fed who would have otherwise starved. Will the heroes set things right no matter the cost? Or do they seek redemption for the bandit based on his good deeds?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Even though each episode’s story will likely be about a partic- ular conflict or villain or problem, the decisions the companions make echo throughout the setting. And when you play a full campaign, you not only encounter the long-term effects of your own actions, but you also see how your character is changed and shaped by the decisions you make. Forging a better future also means forging a new version of yourself!</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Eras</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each game of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>begins with your group picking an era as the backdrop for your game. The eras are each tied to the span of an Avatar’s life—except for the Hundred Year War era during which Avatar Aang was frozen—and focuses on distinct themes which define the type of game you play. The full text of Chapter 2 describes these eras more deeply, but here’s a quick list that describes the rough focus and details of each era:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s20">The Kyoshi Era </span>covers the events right after <i>The Shadow of Kyoshi </i>novel. Play in the Kyoshi Era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if you want to fight in battles against rogues and bandits and deal with governmental corruption as the nations establish their borders.</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roku Era <span class="p">covers the time right after Sozin became Fire Lord and before Roku married. Play in the Roku Era if you want to deal with tensions between different nations and the trials of main- taining an uneasy peace.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s20">The Hundred Year War Era </span>focuses on the time just before Avatar Aang’s awakening at the begin- ning of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Hun- dred Year War era if you want to rebel against unjust rule, protect the weak, and stand up to tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s20">The Aang Era </span>is set immediately after the events of the <i>Imbalance </i>comics trilogy, some time after the end of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Aang Era if you want to heal the world after trage- dy and help push it into a brighter future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s20">The Korra Era </span>covers a period that takes place after the events of the <i>Ruins of the Empire </i>comic trilogy, sometime after the end of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>.

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Four Nations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For centuries, the world has been split into four distinct nations each with their own cultures and customs. While individuals from these nations often form lifelong bonds of friendship and love, the nations themselves are often in conflict. Your heroes may travel from place to place or stay in one location, but they must always contend with the politics and peoples of the places they visit during their adventures.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about the full history of each of the Four Nations—and locations that only exist in later eras, like Repub- lic City—in Chapter 2. For now, here’s a short summary of each of the Four Nations, their history, and some of the most import- ant issues that are likely to arise if they appear in your game.</p>
