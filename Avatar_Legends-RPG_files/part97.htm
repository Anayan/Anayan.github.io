<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Avatarverse is full of all kinds of people. When creating NPCs for the companions to interact with, look to the entire spectrum of humanity. Offer the PCs a rich and diverse set of characters to interact with. It’s not just soldiers, bandits, monks, and kings who inhabit the world, after all! Send in janitors, teachers, cooks, and retirees. Introduce the companions to the radish gardener who dreams of being a pro-bending star, the librarian obsessed with Avatar memorabilia, the single mother who earns money by performing as Avatar Kyoshi in the streets.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Creating NPCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Making NPCs is not difficult! Your game will include countless NPCs who are never named and never exist as much more than one or two lines of description (likely a job or other role). The surly guard. The clumsy cabbage-seller. These NPCs do not need stats.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once the companions interact with an NPC directly, make them memorable with a physical feature, a piece of clothing, a signature gesture or mannerism, or a personality quirk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Generally, steer clear of accents to distinguish PCs—they can play into harmful stereotypes. Sometimes small things,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">like a simple catchphrase, can work better than an elaborately planned vocal performance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Stat up NPCs only when they become important. If they re-appear, become enemies, turn into allies, or if you feel that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">they are important to the story in some way, use the guidelines below to give them stats. It’s absolutely fine to stat up an NPC at the table if you need their numbers, such as when they’re entering a fight or someone <span class="s8">calls them out </span>on their principle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">NPCs come in four flavors of importance. Depending both on their importance to the story and their power level, you can classify NPCs as <span class="s20">minor</span>, <span class="s20">major</span>, <span class="s20">master</span>, and the very rare <span class="s20">legendary</span>. After the description and details of each level of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NPC, you can find a stat guide, an example from <i>Avatar Legends</i>, and a sample of that kind of NPC. You can find more example NPCs—divided by level—in <span class="s20">Appendix B: NPCs</span>.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To stat up an NPC, give them:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• A name and description</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• A drive, i.e. “to accomplish a goal”</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Fatigue track and conditions</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Balance track and principles</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Advanced techniques (as appropriate)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not every NPC needs a full mechanical write-up! Sometimes you can get away with giving an NPC just a balance principle. If you do give an NPC a full fatigue track and conditions, you are saying something about the NPC—that they can fight and participate in combat exchanges. If the NPC cannot participate in combat ex- changes—they have no training—then don’t give them fatigue or conditions. A single inflicted fatigue or condition takes them out.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Name and Description</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part48.htm#bookmark95" class="s22">Use the naming advice in this book (page 114)</a> to come up with a name. Also remember that no society is a monoculture: even during the Hundred Year War Era, people of the different nations mixed, intermarried, and settled in each other’s lands. A street urchin in Omashu might have a Fire Nation name, for example, having descended from Fire Nation immigrants.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">A description can be short and might include the NPC’s training. A feisty bandit. A Waterbender who likes to help those in need. More important characters might need fuller descriptions.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Drive</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What motivates the NPC? What do they feel driven to do? This can be a simple “to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>” phrase. For instance, “to uphold justice” or “to save their village.” Use these drives to help decide how the NPCs react to the companions’ actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Drives can also evolve over the course of a story. NPCs can and should respond to what the companions do, which might in- clude changing their goals (especially if their new goal becomes, “to get revenge on the companions” or something similar).</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Fatigue &amp; Conditions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each NPC should have a fatigue track, usually between 3–10 boxes, as well as one or more conditions; you can pull from the playbook conditions or invent your own to fit the NPC’s person- ality. Minor NPCs have the shortest fatigue tracks (3-fatigue) while legendary NPCs have a full 15-fatigue track!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Principles &amp; Balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unless they’re an unnamed minor NPC, give them a single prin- ciple that matches their essence, their beliefs, or their personal, philosophical struggle. NPC balance principles act both as a guide to how they might behave, and to push the companions into action (and nudge their own balance tracks). In fact, it’s a good idea to give some of your NPCs balance principles that match or directly oppose the companions’ principles. You can create a lot of interesting tension when the companions observe the NPC acting on their principle or when the NPC <span class="s8">calls the companions out</span>! That said, if you’re stuck, grab a principle from an unused playbook and use that.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Advanced Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, NPCs with combat training should know advanced techniques as appropriate to the story and to their level of importance. Minor NPCs probably don’t have any advanced techniques—they just use the basic techniques in a fight—but all other NPCs have mastered a few advanced techniques in line with their training. See <span class="s20">Appendix A: Techniques </span>for the full list of techniques, all of which are available to NPCs!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">NPC Variation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you do give an NPC a mechanical write-up, you can deviate from the proposed guidelines a bit. One greater or fewer fatigue, condition, or balance track point is a relatively small variation that can help you more accurately represent the NPC. See</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Minor NPCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are side characters of low importance to the episode or overall story. Think of the shopkeeper whose produce is stolen from the bazaar, a guard who bars the way, an onlooker at the fair who makes an admiring comment about the companions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Minor NPCs may be named, but just as easily could go un- named. They tend to have rather basic capabilities and if they have combat training, tend to use only the most straightforward tactics:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Earthbenders hurl rocks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Firebenders throw gouts of flame.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Airbenders harness big gusts of wind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Waterbenders channel big jets of water.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Weapons users come swinging in with regular weapons.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Technologists apply obviously dangerous machines (harpoon guns, big tanks).</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do note that players often love to “adopt” minor NPCs and elevate them into positions of importance. If players show a par- ticular interest in a throwaway character, it might be time to up- grade them into a major NPC. Just give them a principle, expand their balance and fatigue tracks, add a few more conditions, and add a few advanced techniques if they have combat training!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fights with minor NPCs might not even need to involve exchanges of techniques. A simple roll of a basic move—some- thing like <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training</span>—will often do. Fights where the outcome is certain—the companions will absolutely win, for instance—don’t trigger a move at all. Most often, when an NPC doesn’t have any kind of combat training, there’s no un- certainty and no need for a move to be triggered; the PC might sweep them aside with a gust of wind or jet of water without even making a move.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">minor npc stat guide:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Minor NPCs often don’t need fatigue, conditions, or balance, especially if they lack combat training. If they do need to be able to participate in combat, give them three fatigue, one condition, and a 0 to +1 balance track.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• Minor NPCs often don’t need a principle—they’re too minor to believe strongly in something—but if necessary, give them something broad or simple like Tradition or Loyalty.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">• Similarly, minor NPCs don’t need advanced techniques.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major NPCs are important to the current episode or overall story: the information broker who knows where the gang is, the guide who helps the companions through the desert, the owner of the tea shop the companions repeatedly return to.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Give them a name or title (the “Best of the Yuyan Archers,” for example), and at least one interesting physical feature, mannerism, or item of clothing (a scar, a stammer, or a vivid purple cloak, for instance). If you find that a minor NPC starts to appear in multiple episodes, it’s a good idea to start thinking of them as a major NPC!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Major NPCs are usually pretty capable and canny. If they’re combatants, they might have their own styles and distinctive visuals:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Earthbenders might hurl rocks, change the environment, or exhibit seismic sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• Firebenders might throw gouts of flame, light the environment aflame, or launch themselves into the air using fire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Airbenders might harness big gusts of wind, throw incoming physical attacks off-course with wind, or glide along on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">air currents or balls of whirling air (“air scooters”).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Waterbenders might channel big jets of water, use ice creatively to shape the environment, or heal (though this is rare).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Weapons users might come swinging in, dance around acrobatically, or attack with strength and power.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Their weapons might be showier or more exotic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Technologists have a few tricks, surprise weapons, and unexpected capabilities to deploy—but only a few.</p>

<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Give major NPCs a balance principle, one that reflects their primary interests and motivations, like Progress or Care.</p>
