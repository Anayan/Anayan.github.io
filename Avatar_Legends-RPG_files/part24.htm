<p class="s23" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Yellow Necks’ Legacy</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Yellow Necks were a large and infamous group that pillaged settlements and murdered civilians regardless of gender or age. Though they reformed under several different names only to collapse time and time again, some former members still want to return to their former power. After their leader Xu Ping An was imprisoned in Zigan Village, they re- branded themselves as the Autumn Bloom Society. Then, once Xu Ping An was killed, another group reformed as the Triad of the Golden Wing. No mat- ter how many times they are defeated, they always seem to come back under some new name.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The police in Ba Sing Se often make bad decisions in their handling of <i>daofei</i>, and it’s not uncommon for civilians to suffer the consequences. Citizens of the Lower Ring are particularly vulnerable to both <i>daofei </i>and law enforcement as they are not prioritized by the Earth Kingdom government. The police are more likely to go after small <i>daofei </i>groups than bigger ones, because they’re scared and the smaller groups are easier targets.</p>

<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">kyoshi era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the Four Nations are at peace, the Fire Nation is pre- pared for any confrontation with the other three nations and has iron-clad strategies for dealing with each of them. Despite that external mistrust, most of the Fire Nation’s problems come from within as they recover from the Camellia-Peony War. Change is coming, and not everyone is prepared for it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s hard to find anyone in power who didn’t have stakes in the Camellia-Peony War. Those who allied with the Saowon Clan, led by Lady Huazo and her son Chaejin, during the succession conflict are potential targets for scrutiny and discrimination. Such is the po- sition of the Fire Sages who backed the Saowon Clan, because their High Sage is the uncle of Lady Huazo. Similarly, merchants who sold their businesses and lands to the Saowon Clan now struggle with damaged reputations. The conflict may have officially ended, but its impact still ripples through the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part17.htm#bookmark30" class="s22">One place where the conflict between the clans remains partic- ularly strong is North Chung-Ling. Both clans had a presence here during the Camellia-Peony War. North Chung-Ling, later known as Fire Fountain City (page 25),</a> is located on Shuhon Island in the eastern part of the Fire Nation. With its reputation as a spiritu- al location due to its vision-inducing natural gas, North Chung- Ling was something of a tourist destination with people setting up fake spiritual experiences and shows for visitors. Sadly, thanks to the clan conflict, the city and its attractions are worn down, and the tension between the clans makes it a dour place to live.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Zoryu</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ruler of the Fire Nation who recently won a succession conflict <span class="p">Fire Lord Zoryu is the leader of the Fire Nation, though he was not very popular with his people during his early reign. Arrogant and vindictive, he would have executed all of the Saowon clan had Kyoshi and Lao Ge of the Flying Opera Company not inter- fered. Zoryu now intends to steadily strip away the various noble clans’ influence so that eventually the Fire Lord remains the only true authority in the Fire Nation.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Heroes with ties to the Saowon clan or any other clan with ambitious plans will find Zoryu a dangerous enemy to have. He would love an excuse to kill Chaejin and would not hesitate to do so if his half-brother escaped house arrest.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chaejin</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Fire Lord’s half-brother who lives as a hostage after losing a succession conflict</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Chaejin is the illegitimate half-brother of Zoryu and wished to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">usurp the throne, though he had no plan as to how he could shape the Fire Nation if he ever achieved that goal. He is now a hostage of the Keohso along with his mother, Lady Huazo. He cares deep- ly about his mother and will likely do just about anything to see her freed, a task he cannot accomplish without outside help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Chaejin has many resources to offer heroes willing to help</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">him, but all of those resources are based in his home of Ma’inka Island. He can make them available in exchange for his freedom, or at least his mother’s. Ma’inka Island is financially prosperous, and Chaejin’s clan was in the process of amassing money to support his bid for the throne before he was defeated.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lady Huazo</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The leader of the Saowon clan living in captivity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lady Huazo is the intelligent and persistent leader of the Saowon clan. She put in a monumental effort to get her son, Chaejin, on the Fire Nation throne during the Camellia-Peony War, but her clan ultimately lost the conflict. Once the late Fire Lord Chaeryu’s mistress, Lady Huazo spent many years working around Chaeryu’s needs until his death finally made it so that Chaejin could return to court.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though their defeat means that both Lady Huazo and Chaejin are prisoners of Fire Lord Zoryu, Huazo is patient and determined. Anyone who interacts with her is liable to be treated like an insignificant inferior, as she cares deeply about power, hierarchy, and appearances. Though her shot at getting her son on the throne is over, she seeks to escape house arrest and may resort to blackmail if given the opportunity.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rangi</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A skilled Firebender who joined The Flying Opera Company to help the Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Since Rangi was once a firebending Fire Army officer, she tends</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to be combative and stubborn and has never shied away from a fight, especially when her loved ones’ safety was at stake. Her training has made her a strong, but authoritative leader who</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">cares deeply about those around her. Though she took the oaths to become a member of the Flying Opera Company to help her girlfriend Kyoshi, Rangi does not generally trust <i>daofei</i>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rangi’s mother is Hei-Ran, the former headmistress of the Royal Fire Academy for Girls. Both are members of the Sei’naka clan who have taught firebending to the royal family for gener- ations. Rangi is a highly competent firebending instructor, and any Firebender would be lucky to have her as a teacher. She is also knowledgeable about how to deal with <i>daofei</i>, so heroes in need of help who aren’t strictly on either side of the law might turn to Rangi for insider information.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hei-Ran</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A master Firebender learning to delegate as she recovers from injury <span class="p">Once the Headmistress of the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, and then Yun’s firebending teacher, Hei-Ran is a skilled Firebender who was once friends with Avatar Kuruk and is also Rangi’s mother. A former student of the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, Hei-Ran held a reputation as a truly dangerous opponent in Agni Kais and still holds the record for most “accidental” kills.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She has taken a break from most strenuous things after recover- ing from a serious injury Yun inflicted on her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Hei-Ran has many connections, including former colleagues from the Academy, and she may ask them to assist her in matters connected to the Fire Nation or the Avatar now that she is re- tired. If there is corruption or something suspicious going on at the Academy, she may be able to pull some strings there as well.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A Fire Sage with extensive spiritual knowledge and experience with dark spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Nyahitha was a Fire Sage who studied and hunted dark spirits with</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Kuruk in secret. He was also Kuruk’s drinking buddy, in large part because Kuruk needed an outlet for his depression that developed from dealing with said spirits. Slotted to be High Sage, Nyahitha fell out of favor when the eldest uncle from an opposing clan to his own took the position. Though Nyahitha now works as a charlatan fortune-teller in North Chung-Ling, he is still capable of great things and helped Kyoshi connect to Kuruk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If someone is suffering from a spiritual sickness or injury, Nyahitha might be able to diagnose and treat it. He is less likely to directly help with dark spirits, however, since he has bad memories connected to his time fighting them with Kuruk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Should heroes need his assistance with such matters, they need to convince him that he is singularly suited to helping them.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keohso Clan</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Abuse of Authority</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Keohso clan was one of the two noble houses involved in the Camellia-Peony War. Fire Lord Zoryu’s late mother was Keohso, so that clan is extremely loyal to the throne. Though the succession conflict is over, there is still tension between the Keohso and Saowon clans. The Keohso are brutally unforgiving when one of their own does business with the Saowon, and any Keohso showing outright sympathy risks being attacked.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Heroes may be pressured to reveal their loyalties while in the Fire Nation, or have a target painted on their backs for associ- ating with members of the Saowon clan. Now that the Keohso clan’s claim on the throne is cemented, important figures within the clan vie for standing and influence. Unfortunately for them, Zoryu is set on establishing the Fire Lord’s voice as the only one that truly matters in the Fire Nation.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Saowon Clan</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Justice and Revenge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Saowon clan was the noble house on the other side of the Camellia-Peony War. In a relatively short span of time they grew from a weak clan to a thriving, influential one. Nonetheless, they lost the succession conflict. With their leader, Lady Huazo, and her son, Chaejin, under house arrest, the Saowon are without their two most important leaders. Though it would be incredibly risky, the clan almost surely has aspirations of breaking them out, but if they aren’t careful, they are likely to start another civil war.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Life is not easy for the Saowon clan right now, so members may plead with companions to conduct business on their behalf in situations where their clan name presents a problem. Com- panions with ties to the clan might visit their home on Ma’inka Island and assist in the clan’s reorganization now that Chaejin and Lady Huazo are imprisoned by Zoryu. Power and responsi- bilities must change hands with the two leaders gone, and if the clan is to survive, leadership needs to pass to someone ready to do the hard work.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fall of Noble Clans</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Harmony Without, Turmoil Within</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ever since the end of the Camellia-Peony War, Fire Lord Zoryu has worked to slowly dismantle the noble clans. He believes a central Fire Nation government will prevent potential future civil wars. His plan is expansive and generational, but the work has begun. Though the Keohso technically won the conflict suc- cession, Zoryu’s plans for the future of the Fire Nation extend to all of the noble clans—including the Keohso.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those who belong to noble clans may start to see their people’s power slipping away, and they either have to adapt or fight against it. Some clan leaders may now be sycophants in the presence of the Fire Lord in order to maintain what power they have, while others may prefer to let their clans’ power fade over behaving in such a way.</p>

</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">kyoshi era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads have isolated themselves while struggling with mounting internal issues. Leading into this era, Earth Kingdom Sages blamed the Air Nomads’ detachment for Kuruk’s failures as an Avatar. This tension continued when the Air Nomads of the Southern Air Temple provided sanctuary to Kyoshi after her con- frontation with Jianzhu. Many opposed the idea that she was the true Avatar, but the Air Nomads still took her in. This has culmi- nated in the Air Nomad Elders focusing their people on internal matters, not only to avoid conflict, but as a matter of survival.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Thriving towns near Air Nomad temples struggle with ban- ditry, causing the townsfolk to leave to larger cities in search of work and safety. Having been burned one too many times by in- terfering with others’ lives, many Nomads are hesitant to get too involved unless asked for direct assistance. Rather than working with the towns to build a sustainable life near the temples, the Air Nomads accept that each individual has free will and must do what they need to thrive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This detachment is compounded by the loss of spiritual sites, which Air Nomads have protected for years. Avatar Kuruk’s mission to destroy Dark Spirits left many spiritual sites in the hu- man world unattended. While the Air Nomads struggled to pick up the slack, their mission fails and comes to an end in this era. Thanks to human meddling and lack of care, the final few spirits residing at these sites will pull their homes into the Spirit World, further separating humans and spirits. Air Nomads accept that reversing what’s happening is a lost cause, and now focus on protecting the sites while they still remain and recording what knowledge they can before it is lost to humans forever.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Four Councils of Elders</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An esteemed council of Air Nomads who serve as leaders</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each Air Temple is governed by a separate council of elders. Members of the elder councils are master Airbenders, having earned their tattoos and more before serving their people. These elders serve as leaders in both political and religious capacities, and help to identify the Avatar during eras when the Avatar is born into the Air Nomads. The Council of Elders at the South- ern Air Temple took Kyoshi in during the tumultuous time right after her reveal of her Avatar status. The Elders can be set in their ways, however, as the Southern Air Temple Elders exiled Kel- sang and marked him in a lower place of honor in their registers because he had taken lives. Airbenders seeking spiritual guid- ance may want to ask their local Council of Elders for advice, or the Elders may send an Airbender out into the world to pursue some mission if they truly believe it serves the greater good.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Namthöse</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An Air Nomad elder set on keeping Airbenders out of the world’s troubles</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Namthöse is an esteemed member of the Northern Air Temple’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Council of Elders. He is an avid proponent for the Air Nomads staying uninvolved in the conflicts of the world and actively tries to discourage young Airbenders from absorbing too much outside news for fear they will become distracted from their paths. Currently, he is trying to instate a rule to allow only Air Nomads to visit the Northern Air Temple while also preventing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Airbenders still in training there from interacting with outsiders. He believes that the other three nations are so prone to violence that they must not be permitted to influence young Airbenders in any way. Foreigners who have business with the Northern Air Temple find it very hard to get in touch with anyone other than those Namthöse deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jinpa</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An air monk, secretary to the Avatar, and secret member of the White Lotus</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">A monk from the Southern Air Temple, Jinpa is Kyoshi’s secre-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tary and a member of the White Lotus. Jinpa excels at handling the intricacies of political and diplomatic matters and tries to keep Kyoshi in check when she gets carried away with dealing with the corrupt through violence. Though he chooses pacifism when he can, he understands that sometimes a fight is necessary for the greater good. He is secretly involved with the Order of the White Lotus and takes his responsibilities as a member seri- ously, doing his best to help Kyoshi become a great Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">During this era, the Order of the White Lotus’s activities and very existence are hidden from the public. Jinpa may occasion- ally drop hints to Kyoshi about his involvement, but he never admits to anything outright. Those who heard rumors about the secret order and want to do good in the world may find the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">group very attractive, but discovering any information about it is a challenge all on its own. Jinpa isn’t likely to reveal the existence of the Order, but could be swayed if the Avatar’s life is at stake.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Matangi</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The head of an Earth Kingdom orphanage outside the Eastern Air Temple</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Matangi, a renegade Air Nun, is the head of an orphanage in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earth Kingdom, despite advice from the elders to stay out of world- ly affairs. She originally founded the orphanage to help children orphaned in the Yellow Neck Uprising, where the crisis led to a large number of deaths. Many of those children are grown-ups or teenagers now, and sometimes they come back to her for help when they run into trouble. Whenever one of her former charges turns out to be in a <i>daofei </i>group, she is torn between staying uninvolved and helping them. Much of the time, she can’t bring herself to turn her back on those who need her no matter what the circumstances.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Matangi has a way of fostering greatness. Heroes who need to find someone who grew up in the orphanage may seek her out, but she only gives information if she trusts them not to hurt her former charges. Many of the children she helped raise would do anything for her, so she has quite a network of contacts to pull from when disaster strikes as well.</p>
