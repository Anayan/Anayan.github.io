<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">NPCs, Techniques, and Changing Balance</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The number of techniques an NPC can use for their approach is determined by 1 + their current balance at the start of that approach. In other words, if an NPC <b>defends and maneuvers </b>and has a principle of</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">+1 at the start of the resolution of the <b>defend and maneuver </b>approach, they get to use two techniques.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">An NPC who shifts their balance before resolving their approach might get a different number of techniques. If a PC uses Strike against that same NPC during <b>ad- vance and attack</b>, thereby shifting the NPC’s balance and increasing their principle to +2, the NPC gets to use three techniques during <b>evade and observe</b>.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The NPC’s balance at the start of their chosen approach is all that matters. Whatever their balance was at the start of the exchange is irrelevant!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Stance Move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choosing an approach only declares the basic style a combatant uses during an exchange—each combatant still has to choose specific techniques to use. An NPC can always use a number of techniques equal to their balance rating +1. To determine how many techniques a PC combatant can use, they make the <span class="s8">stance move </span>when resolving approaches: each player rolls with the appropriate stat, based on the approach they chose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">or <span class="s49">Harmony</span>, the PC’s choice</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a 7–9, use one basic or mastered technique. On a 10+, choose one from this list instead:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Mark 1-fatigue to use a learned technique</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Use one practiced technique</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Use two different basic or mastered techniques</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a miss, you stumble, but you can shift your balance away from center to use one basic technique.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that this means on a miss, you can almost always use one basic technique, but only a basic technique—you can’t use any advanced techniques on a miss, even mastered ones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The disadvantage of using a learned or practiced technique is that you must roll a 10+ on the <span class="s8">stance move</span>, and for a learned technique you must pay an additional cost. But because you don’t choose tech- niques until after you have rolled the stance move, you can always choose to use a basic or mastered technique on a 7–9, even if you were hoping to get to use your learned or practiced technique.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Step-By-Step Exchange</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you know who the combatants are in the exchange, follow these steps to resolve the exchange:</p>
<p class="s55" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 1</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GM chooses approaches</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">For each non-player combatant in the exchange, the GM choos- es an approach. The GM should note these approaches down but keep them secret—the players don’t get to know what approaches the NPCs chose when they decide what to do. The GM doesn’t choose any techniques yet.</p>
<p class="s55" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 2</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each player chooses approaches</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">For each PC in the exchange, their player chooses their ap- proach. Players should feel free to discuss what approaches they’re choosing, and don’t have to keep it secret. Players don’t choose any techniques yet. If the PCs are fighting each other for some reason—a rare occurrence, but possible—then they choose approaches secretly.</p>
<p class="s55" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 3</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GM reveals what they chose for each NPC</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The GM reveals their chosen approaches, and any other un- revealed approaches are now revealed, so every combatant’s chosen approach is public.</p>
<p class="s55" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEPS 4-6</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resolve each approach</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Resolve the approaches in order, starting with all <b>defend and maneuver </b>approaches, followed by all <b>advance and attack </b>approaches, followed by all <b>evade and observe </b>approaches. When resolving each approach, PCs who chose that approach roll the <b>stance move </b>to see how many techniques they may use. NPCs use techniques equal to 1 + their current balance as it stands specifically at the start of that approach.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">PCs choose their techniques first, and then the NPCs choose their techniques to use. All techniques within an approach are functionally resolved simultaneously.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part64.htm#bookmark124" class="s46">If anyone is taken out or loses their balance, they don’t suffer those consequences yet, even if their approach hasn’t been re- solved yet. The same goes for statuses (page </a>151)—the effect of the status doesn’t kick in until the exchange ends.</p>
<p class="s55" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 7</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resolve being taken out or losing your balance</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Now, whoever has been taken out or lost their balance resolves those effects. If necessary, PCs resolve first, and NPCs second. Remember that because you don’t resolve <b>losing your balance </b>until this step, then before this step, your balance still counts as its highest possible extreme (+3 for PCs, and +1, +2, +3, or higher for NPCs depending upon their status). That means even if a PC loses their balance, they might be able to <b>live up to their prin- ciple </b>one last time with it at +3 before the end of the exchange. Similarly, an NPC still gets the benefit of their high balance in one last exchange before they lose their balance.</p>

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">After the Exchange</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The full effects of a character being taken out or losing their balance resolve outside of fight exchanges. While a character might know they are taken out during the <span class="s8">advance and attack </span>approach phase or lose their balance during the <span class="s8">evade and observe </span>approach phase, they don’t actually get taken out until the exchange is over.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">When a PC <span class="s8">loses their balance</span>, their player chooses options, and the GM says what happens without uncertainty—everyone at the table knows that a character lost their balance, and the full effect of that move must come into play. A character losing their balance is at an inflection point for their story!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, when a PC is taken out, they are unable to act any more. The exact details of how they are taken out can be set up outside of fight exchanges—but almost always, a PC being taken out is a golden opportunity for the GM to make another move. That might lead to the PC getting captured or the NPCs acting with impunity to take what they were after or otherwise win the day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember that after an exchange ends, there is no require- ment to go right into another exchange. The combatants break apart after their exchange of blows, and maybe they decide to throw words at each other as they breathe heavily and circle each other, looking for a better position. Maybe no combatants want to fight anymore. Maybe a combatant has decided that fighting directly is a losing strategy, so they quickly set fire to their sur- roundings, hoping to distract the companions with danger.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If multiple combatants want to keep fighting, then another exchange ensues. This also covers situations in which one side wants to only defend or evade—they’re still “fighting,” still actively participating in the exchange, even if it’s only to protect themselves. If only one combatant (or one side of combatants) wants to keep fighting—to the extent that their targets won’t even resist incoming blows—then no exchange is needed; the attackers simply inflict fatigue or conditions on their targets. And if no combatants are engaging each other, then there’s no need for an exchange at all!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This also helps sort out when a fight’s fully over. If all combatants on one side of the conflict are defeated, unable to continue fighting in any way, then no more exchanges are needed! The GM uses the drives and balance principles of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">involved NPCs to determine how they react, as well. If a group of soldiers have their leader knocked out by the PCs, then sol- diers with a drive “To survive” are going to run! Similarly, if all the PCs are defeated or flee, the GM can decide how the NPCs react—capturing the PCs, fleeing themselves, etc.—based on their drives and balance principles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">For the most part, long combats that run for many exchanges until both sides are totally exhausted are quite rare in <span class="s10">Avatar Leg- ends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Instead, both PCs and NPCs usually take the chance offered by the end of an exchange to pursue new tactics, offer a truce, or get away from the fight!</p>
