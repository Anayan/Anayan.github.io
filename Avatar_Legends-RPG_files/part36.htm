<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spirit Energy</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Given the world’s burgeoning power demands, some inventors now look to spirit energy as a possible solution. The potential for this new energy source seems near-limitless. With new technologies and urbanization on the rise, this energy source could be just what the nations need to push them into the future.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark69" class="s25">However, this is an increasingly controversial topic thanks in part to Kuvira’s creation of a destructive super weapon (page </a>81). Many people, such as Avatar Korra, are wary of spirit energy and be- lieve spirit-based energy is a non-starter, not only</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">because of the destruction it can cause, but also for how it could potentially harm humans’ relationship with the spirits even more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bolin</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A skilled Earthbender who can bend lava</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bolin grew up with his older brother Mako on the streets of Republic City after their parents were killed by a Firebender. They made their own way, and became pro-bending athletes, the Fire Ferrets, with Avatar Korra later joining their team. Bolin is an impressive Earthbender who later learned to bend lava. He’s goofy, kind, and rarely seen without his loyal companion, a fire ferret named Pabu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After his time as a pro-bender, Bolin starred in movers (moving picture films) for a time before a stint working as an officer in Kuvira’s military. When Bolin realized Kuvira’s nefarious inten- tions for the Earth Kingdom, he broke free from her influence and aided the Avatar in defeating Kuvira’s giant mecha. Recently, he decided to pursue a career in politics, and now works as President Moon’s assistant.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mako</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A skilled Firebender and Republic City detective</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the older brother, Mako has always felt a heavy sense of dutiful responsibility. When the boys were young, he did ev- erything in his power to protect Bolin. This led to Mako having a sternness and no-nonsense attitude, which he’s softened over the years through caring for the people he loves. Today, he’s thoughtful, pensive, and able to bend fire and lightning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Firebender dated both Asami Sato and Avatar Korra; while the two women are now in a relationship with one anoth- er, Mako still loves and supports both of them as friends. Mako’s innate warmth and willingess to do what it takes to protect the people he loves has made him an integral part of the Avatar’s entourage. Through the years, Mako has worked his way up from being a beat cop to a detective in Republic City’s police force.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Republic City Spirit Portal</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Industrialization vs. Tradition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Republic City spirit portal is a source of constant conflict and its location in the middle of a big city draws a lot of atten- tion. President Zhu Li Moon withdrew the United Forces from the area when she won the election with the goal of promoting peace and cooperation instead of fear. Should conflict between spirits and humans escalate again, however, this spirit portal likely sits at the center of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Surrounded by tangled spirit vines, the portal once led to a meadow of flowers, though the spirits have razed the area just inside the portal to discourage meddling humans from crossing over into the Spirit World. Those wishing to enter the Spirit World may try to use this portal since it is more easily accessible than the frigid wilderness of the North and South Poles where the two other portals are located. But to do so, they’ll have to contend with members of the Air Nation, who protect the area.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Triads</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several triads operate within Republic City, and some of these criminal organizations have large numbers and powerful con- nections. Government officials and corporations have a history of hiring the triads to do their dirty work. Some of the most well-known triads in the city include the Triple Threats and the Creeping Crystal Triad.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Being part of a triad is dangerous work, as members have both law enforcement and other triads to worry about. Much of the time there is also the threat of backstabbing within the ranks of any triad as well. Anyone involved with a triad needs to be prepared for a lot of deceit, betrayal, and in-fighting. Heroes who make an enemy out of a triad find Republic City exponentially more dangerous.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remaining Red Lotus Supporters</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Extremism Born of Fear</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Korra and her allies defeated the known core of the Red Lotus, but it is impossible to know how many supporters are still out there and whether they may be planning another attack on the Avatar. Without any clear leaders, ambitious plans usually re- main just that—plans, and nothing more. Zaheer still lives, and while breaking him out of prison would be incredibly difficult, the prison’s defenses may not stop his followers from trying.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that the three other leaders are dead, members of the Red Lotus looking to climb to a place of power and authority may see this as a perfect opportunity. An aspiring leader struggling to gain acceptance in the Red Lotus might even launch a reckless attack against the Avatar or her supporters in order to prove they are right for the job.</p>

</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Korra Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though both Water Tribes were at war only years ago, relations between the two are now relatively calm. The tribes were all but officially separate for years, but now each works to define who they are with true independence. Both the North and South maintain lines of communication with one another, ever</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">careful not to slip into old patterns from when they were united. The twins Desna and Eska currently lead the Northern Water Tribe, having taken up governing the tribe after their father was defeated by Korra, and Tonraq (Avatar Korra’s father) leads the Southern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska, though exceedingly dour in nature, do not intend to make the same mistakes as their father, and they focus the North on making healthy connections with the outside world. As tradition states, the North must always care for the spirits, but in this modern age more is needed. While the leaders are loath to admit it, and thus show it in their actions instead, the North can no longer stand on its own in an era of increased international cooperation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Water Tribe is the largest it’s ever been, having seen a much-needed population boom since the end of the Hundred Year War. Relations between the tribes are aided by the relationship between their leaders; Desna and Eska are Tonraq’s nephew and niece, and while they fought against their uncle during the civil war, all three now enjoy a more peaceful relationship. The Southern Tribe’s ability to adapt and overcome offered them many boons in the modern era. International ven- tures of Southern Tribe businesspeople see widespread success across the world and foster a boom in industry and an expansion of their wares across the globe.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tonraq and Senna</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Avatar’s parents and the caretakers of the Southern Water Tribe <a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">Tonraq and Senna are Avatar Korra’s parents, and Tonraq has been the official Chief of the Southern Water Tribe since the tribe gained its independence. The civil war was hard on the couple for many reasons, one of them being that Unalaq (page </a>
<span class="p">80), Tonraq’s brother, violently attacked Tonraq and tried to kill his daughter. Being the parents of the Avatar isn’t easy, and Korra even turned against her father at one time, believing he</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">didn’t trust her to make wise decisions in regards to her training.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Senna, by far the calmest and most composed of the three family members, sometimes must act as a grounding force for the other two. When a brewing problem appears in the Southern Water Tribe, Tonraq and Senna are often some of the first to know about it. Heroes who discover something afoot in the tribe might want to bring the information to them so they can prepare for what’s coming.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kya</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A master Waterbender, healer, and warrior</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kya is Aang and Katara’s daughter, and, like her mother, she is a skilled Waterbender and healer who has traveled extensively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kya lives in the Southern Water Tribe but goes where she is needed. Most recently, she traveled to Republic City after Kuvi- ra’s uprising to help in the evacuee camps. When disaster strikes, she can quickly switch between healing the injured and taking on attackers without missing a beat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a queer woman, Kya is particularly supportive of Korra and Asami’s relationship. She has a nurturing streak as well as a bit of a snarky one, but she never lets a grudge or hurt feelings stand between her and protecting her family. Kya is also ex- tremely perceptive and uses that skill to her advantage, when not distracted by one of her siblings. She does have some lingering pain, though, from her father favoring Tenzin, the Airbender, over his other children.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twin leaders of the Northern Water Tribe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska are the twin waterbending leaders of the North- ern Water Tribe who took over after their father’s corruption and defeat. The two are practically inseparable and share similar affectations—namely, a constant air of mild disdain. Though they remained loyal to their father almost until his demise, the twins do not hold any ill will towards Korra for her conflict with their father, as they recognize that he was no longer the father they knew when their battle took place.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Eska and Desna spend their time governing the Northern Water Tribe, and anyone who wants to get on the good side of one must get on the good side of both, but the twins have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">little tolerance for insincere sycophants. Heroes who want their respect are best served by being honest and direct with them, though they still may get drolly mocked in return.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varrick</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An absurdly wealthy businessman who excels at getting into and out of trouble</p>

<a href="part37.htm#bookmark73" class="s22">Tribe, and went on to become an extraordinarily wealthy busi- nessman, making some truly bad decisions along the way. He was partly responsible for the Water Tribe civil war, escalating the conflict by orchestrating the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center and blaming the attack on the North, but the businessman escaped without suffering the full consequenc- es of his actions. He took part in stoking another war by aiding Kuvira (page 87)</a> in creating the technology to harvest power from spirit vines. However, upon realizing that Kuvira planned to use these vines as a weapon, Varrick worked together with Korra to stop the would-be dictator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark70" class="s22">Varrick is married to President Moon (page </a>82). His over-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the-top personality makes him hard to ignore. While self-cen- tered, Varrick is also clever, supportive of his friends, and has a steadily growing sense of integrity. He certainly has enough money to assist in the most outlandish of endeavors so long as someone can sell him on the idea.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska lead the Northern Water Tribe since their father died trying to kill the Avatar, but it can be hard for some people to trust in leaders who are so young. What’s worse is that some citizens of the Northern Water Tribe may look at the twins and see two children who betrayed their father instead of two leaders who made the correct decision in a difficult situation. The twins are also not the most personable leaders and their acerbic wit can make for tense political situations. With the world in flux, it may be the perfect time for conspirators in the Northern Water Tribe to strike at their leaders and take over. Desna and Eska are skilled Waterbenders who can defend themselves, but they may need help if someone corrupt attempts to usurp them or makes them seem incompetent.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark70" class="s22">These two portals caused a lot of trouble for the Avatar a few years ago during the civil war, and they remain points of interest for those looking to take advantage of or harm the Spirit World. The spirit portal in Republic City is guarded by the Air Nomads now, but the two original portals are not as strictly protected since they sit out in the wild, in the middle of frigid wastelands. But these natural barriers have become less of a deterrent as technology advances past anyone’s expectations. Unlike centu- ries before, the tribes in charge of protecting these portals are pulled in new directions balancing a modern world with their spiritual duties. Cunning businessmen like Wonyong Keum (page 82)</a> may think of new ways to exploit the portals for money, though any such plans are almost guaranteed to backfire.</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes have traditionally accepted same-sex relation- ships so long as people keep them quiet. Now that Avatar Korra and Asami are out about their relationship, they may inspire other queer Water Tribe members to come out as well. This has also led to many of the younger generation in the Northern Wa- ter Tribe question the relevance of their parents arranging their marriages for them. It’s a modern world to them and people should be able to love who they want confidently and proudly. Traditionalists may not take well to this more open behavior, while those quietly supportive may struggle to vocalize their support for fear of ostracization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska have made it clear that gender plays no role</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in deciding who can and cannot marry each other. When they receive pushback against this decree, they have been known to make more personal appearances at same-sex weddings shortly after. Some believe that they do this just to amuse themselves, but those close to the twin rulers know that they truly support these relationships and aren’t going to change their minds.</p>
