</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The capital of the Earth Kingdom and by far the largest city in the Avatarverse, Ba Sing Se is akin to a small country in itself. This “Impenetrable City” is known for its famous walls that protect</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part16.htm#bookmark28" class="s22">it and can be opened only with the power of earthbending. The walls divide the city into “rings” based on social status: the Outer Wall, Agrarian Zone, Inner Wall, Lower Ring, Middle Ring, and Upper Ring (read more about Ba Sing Se on page 22).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As such, Ba Sing Se is a city both grand and rife with conflict. It’s a perfect place for PCs beginning a story—whether they stay to explore the city’s wonders and dark secrets or embark from the capital to virtually anywhere in the world—or for an estab- lished group during an ongoing campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For the purposes of this adventure, the focus is on Ba Sing Se’s Middle Ring, but the broader city holds innumerable loca- tions of note! To list them all would be an endless task. Here are the locations that pertain to Rose’s kidnapping:</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Flying Koi Carnival</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sprawling across nine square city blocks in Ba Sing Se’s Middle Ring, the Flying Koi Carnival feels like stepping into a completely different city, one that is lively and thriving and aglow well into the night. Jewel-toned tents in every imaginable pattern—from paisley to polka dot to plum blossom—fill the circus with guests,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and cartwheeling, fire-breathing, stilt-walking performers pack the alleys between. An aromatic swirl of sugary candy and bean cakes permeates the air, tinged with savory burnt notes from rows of meat smokers. A chaotic checkerboard of food stalls, carnival games, and tents filled with oddities and attractions surrounds the massive big top tent, the site of each evening’s feature show. Along the back edge of the carnival, furthest from the entrance, is a neighborhood of darkened tents where the performers and ringmaster live. Despite the joyous veneer of the Flying Koi, remember it is the operating base of a thieves’ ring! Pickpockets, rigged games, and other little clues scratch away at the carnival’s happy rainbow surface.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Stone Kettle</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A dingy little tea shop, the Stone Kettle is tucked in an alley off a boisterous restaurant row in the Middle Ring, not far from the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flying Koi Carnival. It’s the sort of spot tourists might overlook, but local workers know they can get a good strong cup of black tea between shifts. Tended by Hua or another Paper Lantern member, the Stone Kettle appears to be a simple storefront, large enough for a small counter, a shelf of tea canisters, and a single dine-in two-top, while hiding stairs under the counter that lead to the large basement headquarters of the Paper Lantern Gang.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Although Hua has the authority to give anyone access to the secret headquarters, other Paper Lantern guards require entrants to share a passcode that changes daily, depending on what Cong eats for breakfast. The headquarters is spacious and lush, its walls intricately decorated in framed papercut art pieces made by Cong. One of several doors off the main headquarters leads to a small art studio where Gang Leader Cong prefers not to be disturbed.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Black Market</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the clock strikes midnight in Ba Sing Se’s Lower Ring, everyone knows to stay out of the abandoned watch factory on the southeast edge of town…unless they want trouble. A double knock followed by the kick of a toe on the right door grants an opportunity to whisper the password of the day… if you dare.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This is where Ba Sing Se’s grimy, slimy, sly underbelly gathers nightly to make deals, gamble, and trade illegal and stolen goods. If you’re looking for information, you’ll probably find someone willing to sell it, assuming you’re desperate or daring. If the PCs gain entry, they’re rewarded with a good story and some rumors at least. Maolo and Anri might be spotted here selling stolen art. Ibuki often lurks in the shadows looking for an opportunity to make some coin. The Paper Lantern Gang used to frequent the Black Market but haven’t since the Flying Koi have given them trouble.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Rose’s Villa</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rose’s villa is characterized by a stately, dignified quality. Everything is spotless. Everything has its place. A mix of Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation artifacts and art decorate the walls and halls as if the villa were a museum and not a home. Rose’s room, untouched since her disappearance, stands in stark contrast. The desk is stacked high with scrolls and paper, the bed is unmade, and the closet is a disor- ganized mess with a pile of laundry in one corner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Amid this mess, the PCs might find clues to Rose’s disappear- ance, her secret romance with Hua, and perhaps even a plot to kid- nap herself and frame Cong. In addition to the clues of Rose’s own plotting, consider hiding false clues Rose might have left behind that Detective Ziming missed, clues that point to Cong as the kidnapper.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Moon Peach Inn</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This once charming inn has seen better days since its original owner passed and left the property to a frantic son trying to live up to his mother’s memory. Peeling patterned wallpaper and pilling velvet canopies are hallmarks of this Middle Ring inn’s glorious past. While older clientele still visit to reminisce, the Moon Peach Inn is otherwise a place for those who’d rather be forgotten: the perfect spot for Rose to hide if she’s kidnapped herself, or for Ibuki to hide her on behalf of Detective Ziming.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Two bits of wonder remain at the old Moon Peach: all the rooms overlook a central courtyard filled with moon peach trees, and it’s said the original owner’s ghost haunts the halls at dusk offering moon peach cakes before an early retirement to the Spirit World.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Middle Ring Earthmarket</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This bustling farmers’ market boasts all the Earth Kingdom has to offer: bean curd puffs, braised turtle-duck, deep-fried pickled rad- ishes, cozy jook, and dumplings galore. Be sure to stop by the Cab- bage Merchant’s booth for his famous cabbage cookies. Booths of fresh produce and culinary delights are arranged in a ring befitting Ba Sing Se itself, around a circular courtyard with a large bronze bear statue in the center. Like spokes of a wheel, streets extend through the Middle Ring in all directions from the courtyard and, conveniently, lead to any of the previously listed locations.</p>
