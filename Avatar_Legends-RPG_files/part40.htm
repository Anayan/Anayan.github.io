<a name="bookmark77">&zwnj;</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The best way to keep the conversation moving is for your group to <span class="s20">frame scenes</span>—situations that put the companions in the middle of interesting conflicts and opportunities. Instead of sitting around talking about legendary characters and the history of the Four Nations, your group should put your companions into concrete locations with concrete objectives. Don’t say, “Oh, these Equalist terrorists in Republic City are scary!”—frame a scene in which the companions come upon terrorists planting a bomb under a bridge.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM has the most responsibility for framing scenes— they ultimately decide which scenes get played and which don’t—but everyone in the group can help ensure scenes start in a compelling place and go somewhere meaningful. Any player can offer up scenes for the group, contributing to the narrative by suggesting a scene to push the story forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are lots of ways to push the story forward, not all of which are dire or melodramatic. Both Team Aang and Team Korra had plenty of time to tell jokes and hang out with friends. But those scenes were also opportunities for something interesting to happen! Interludes are a huge part of what makes the show great, but they always set up the next interesting thing—finding the bomb!—that moves the characters to action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This might all sound complicated, but once you get started, the rules of the game (and the GM) help keep things running smooth- ly. Just think about your story like an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. Cut straight to the good stuff— the dramatic struggles against dangerous villains, the passionate discussions about what’s right and wrong in a tough situation, or the quieter scenes of your companions having fun and getting to know each other. <span class="s20">Skip the boring stuff and get right to the core of what’s happening or what’s about to happen.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The companions have just closed out a fight against a Republic City gang using advanced Equalist tech, and the GM is looking to set a new scene. “Hey, so I think we cut to the police station, right? Lin Beifong is gonna have a few questions for you…” the GM says.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Wait! Hold up! I wouldn’t want to go answer those questions yet, not until I have more answers for myself!” Tyrelle holds up his hand. “I’ve got Technology training! I’d want to go investi- gate their equipment and figure out if it’s new or old.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM stops to consider. Tyrelle wants his character, Teru Jinno, to look into the Equalist weapons…but that doesn’t sound like a thrilling scene for the other characters. It also sounds like it might be resolved without any additional mechanics. After all, it doesn’t seem that uncertain—it’s not like the origins of the equipment are particularly hidden or hard to find for a technology expert.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“How about this—we cut to you all in your hideout in the city’s Spirit Wilds, and Teru is bent over a workbench, taking apart the glove. You’ve figured out these gloves are definitely older, originat- ing from the original Equalist uprising. And that’s when the door smashes inward; standing on the other side are Lin Beifong and her Metalbenders! ‘I’ve got some questions for you kids,’ she says.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Izzy, Iris’s player, groans, and Nadja, Nokahhak’s player, says, “Aaah! She’s here in our hideout! Lin is my idol!”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The GM grins and asks—“What do you do now?”</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Hard Scene Framing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes the GM wants to quickly move things along or jump right into a tense or difficult situation. Maybe the consequences of an earlier decision have come to bear, hard and fast—a spirit you angered in a previous session decides to wreak havoc, or you have to appear before Republic City’s chief of police to explain why you let a Triple Threat Triad gangster go free. The GM tells you what’s happening and all you can do is react!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This technique is called <span class="s20">hard scene framing</span>, mostly because there’s less room for negotiation: the scene starts and the com- panions must react as best they can to the unfolding drama. While villains may love to monologue, sometimes they don’t give the PCs a chance to plan before they unleash their dastardly schemes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s a bit later, after the scene with Lin. The PCs have split up to tend to their myriad of personal responsibilities. There’ve been a couple of light-hearted, quieter scenes so far, and the GM is looking to ramp up the tension again. They turn to Peng’s play- er, Paxton. “Peng, you were headed back to the pro-bending arena to check in with your team, right?” the GM asks.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yep, I want to make sure I at least show my face at practice so they don’t kick me off the team!” Paxton says.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 5pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Excellent,” says the GM. They could set a scene with Peng ar- riving at the training area, palling around with teammates, hav- ing some emotional scenes or arguments…but instead, the GM decides to hard frame a scene to inject some instant tension!</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“You come into the training room, Peng, looking for your teammates, only to see a group of black-clad, masked figures holding the limp forms of your teammates—it looks like you’ve stumbled into an abduction! What do you do?”</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What Do You Do?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What do you do?” is a constant refrain in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. The story moves quickly, and there isn’t time for you to construct detailed plans when Fire Nation soldiers are invading a village or a spirit portal threatens to destroy a city block. Scene framing is about getting characters to the question “What do you do?” as quickly as possible, making the compan- ions’ choices count because they are in the middle of the action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In fact, <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is about action, about stories of the companions seizing the day and making a difference for the people around them. Even scenes with normal conversations, quiet reflection, or intimate moments are dramat- ic or meaningful, as the characters try to address the issues that matter to them by convincing people to act. Every moment in the game isn’t explosions and yelling, but each and every story beat has something important at stake and the PCs must meet the moment!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As Uncle Iroh told Zuko when they were hiding in Ba Sing Se: “Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.” Sometimes there isn’t time to debate the right course of action for hours on end when the people around you need help!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Fictional Positioning</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The setup of scenes is important; it plays a key role in the <span class="s20">fictional positioning </span>of the characters—the place they occupy in the story you create together. A character who is angry,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tired, and ready for a fight has a different fictional position than someone happy and energized, but completely unprepared for conflict—just as a Firebender has a different fictional position than a Waterbender. Your group’s collective understanding of who your characters are, what they are doing, and how they are feeling matters as much as any dice roll or number on your sheet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The world you create together when you play is called <span class="s20">the fiction</span>, the collection of everything happening—and that has already happened—in your story, your episode, your season. The fiction includes the setting of the game, all the history of the Four Nations and their interplay…but more importantly, it includes everything your characters are, have been, and have done. You won’t write down every moment that occurs, but your group has a collective memory, an agreement about what happened and who did what!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sticking to what you’ve contributed to the fiction—to the fictional position you’ve established—even if it makes trouble for your hero and their companions takes discipline. You should practice holding yourself true to what’s already happened, even if you didn’t know at the time how your actions would influence the story. But part of the joy of playing this game is discovering how the fiction adds up and creates surprising and interesting outcomes you never could’ve predicted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Paxton reels at the GM’s description of Peng’s teammates being abducted. “No way! Nobody steals the Iron Seal-Snakes—not un- der my nose! I snatch a cloud of the earthbending disks out of their holders and I fling them at the baddies holding my friends!”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM nods and smiles. “No uncertainty here—they’re taken unawares as you hurl the disks into them. The two black-clad fig- ures holding your friends get smacked to the side…but that’s when you take stock and realize how many of them there really are, espe- cially as a few more slip in from the rooftop windows upon hearing the commotion. It looks like there are about 15 of them now.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh…oh dear. Uh, maybe I shouldn’t have just let them know I was here,” says Paxton.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Maybe, but it’s too late now! They’re closing in on you, their masked faces looking pretty ominous. What do you do?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Knowing that your decisions can have lasting repercussions can make everyone at the table worried about making <i>perfect</i>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">decisions—but crucially, there aren’t really any <i>perfect </i>decisions. Slowing down play to get flawless information and make fool- proof judgements is far more likely to ruin everyone’s fun than leaping into danger and finding out what happens!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s always okay to clarify a situation or hone in on a detail before making a decision and adding to the fiction. All the players and the GM should regularly ask questions and go back and forth to make sure you get on the same page about the fiction and the fictional positioning of the characters—you need to understand, for example, if you are surrounded by a firestorm versus several burning trees, or if you are currently being watched by the public versus being in private (at least to your knowledge).</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, there’s a big difference between wanting to know a bit more about a situation before making a decision and trying to make the decision all over again because you don’t like the mess you caused! Those messy situations are a huge part of what makes <i>the game </i>fun, and the group has to keep everyone honest about sticking to what’s actually happened in the fiction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>works best when both the players <i>and </i>the GM stick to the fiction, building on what’s already been created instead of rewriting the story to fit the current moment. It can be tempting to rewrite something to make the current situation easier—or to introduce tension when things get slow—but you have to trust that the story you’re building together has new places to go. You wouldn’t pull out</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a foundational brick from a structure, and neither should you yank out important, established truths from your fiction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Peng’s battle against the abductors raged out across the roof- top of the arena; the abductors exhibited incredible acrobatic skills and tried to flee while Peng kept up with them and followed them, always trying to yank them back within reach. But after the battle has raged for a while—Peng has a bunch of conditions and fatigue marked, and some of his foes have peeled off (in the GM’s mind, to escape)—Paxton has a sudden realization…</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, shoot, wait—we’re way far away from the training room now, aren’t we? Oh, crud! Are they just going to abduct my teammates? I should’ve put them somewhere safe before chas- ing these guys!” Paxton exclaims.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM considers for a moment—they want to support Peng’s player, so maybe it would be reasonable that Peng quickly put the teammates somewhere safer before running out of the room. But they also realize they need to stay true to the fiction, and it’s interesting that Peng chose to rush forward instead of staying to safely protect their teammates…</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, sorry—you think you see the masked figures who escaped slipping back into the training room below, as the ones still in front of you form a block, preventing you from passing. What do you do now?” says the GM.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Think of it like trying to avoid a bad twist in the show late in a season. It’s frustrating to find out that a character who clearly died, on-screen—there was a body and everything!—never <i>actually </i>died, and they’ve <i>actually </i>been working in secret with the character you <i>thought </i>was their hated enemy! It’s more satisfying to commit to the clarity of the fiction and build on the character’s death to find out what happens to their villainous organization now that they are gone. When you stick to the es- tablished fiction, you create opportunities for the story to grow in unexpected directions!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, you can’t follow up on every plot thread you might generate, especially if the companions keep moving from nation to nation. It’s okay for some things to fade into the background or for an old villain to resurface—having escaped from prison or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">recruited new allies—in order to focus on the things that matter to your story right now. There’s a big difference between defying the logic of your story by ignoring what you established earlier and allowing it to flourish by focusing on what matters right now.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Moves and Dice</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Framing scenes is the first step to an interesting conversation, but it’s the <span class="s20">moves </span>that connect your heroes to the fiction in exciting ways. Each move is a small set of rules that resolves conflicts, answers questions, and pushes the story forward. Moves are like the pro- gramming language of the game—“When you do X, then do Y”— defining the fiction when your characters take meaningful actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One exciting thing about this kind of storytelling is that some- times no one—not even the GM—knows what will happen next. Can a character sneak past the Fire Nation guards? Can they stop a falling boulder from crushing a teammate? In these moments, the moves take center stage, helping you and your group decide what happens to resolve the uncertainty. You don’t just decide as a group—you <span class="s8">trick </span>the guards to get past them or <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>to earthbend the rocks away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the start of the game, every companion gets access to the <span class="s20">basic moves </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark112" class="s22">(page 127)</a> and can use those moves freely. Each companion also gets their own <span class="s20">playbook moves</span>—specific moves that point the characters in specific directions—and can add more moves over the course of play as they grow. In general,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">basic moves cover situations that come up all the time, while other moves cover more character-specific or rare situations.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Triggering Moves</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moves don’t fire off whenever you think it might be interesting; they are instead triggered by something you say in the conversa- tion, usually an action your hero takes in the fiction. <span class="s20">If you want to trigger a move, you have to do the thing that triggers it. </span>You can always avoid making a move, but then you have to avoid taking that action in the fiction. Since every move ties directly into the fiction, all moves are governed by the same idea: <i>to do it, you do it</i>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you want to <span class="s8">plead with an NPC </span>for help finding a lost child, you have to openly ask an NPC for help, perhaps begging the chief of a village to help you search in the blizzard outside. And if you de- cide to fall to your knees and beg the chief for help, you’re <span class="s8">pleading with an NPC </span>and the move triggers…whether you like it or not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Paxton isn’t sure how his character, Peng, can both defeat his opponents and rescue his kidnapped teammates. “I…I put my hands up. ‘Wait, wait,’ I say. ‘Look, can we work something out? What do you want, money? I can get you money,’” Paxton says.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM briefly considers Paxton’s attempt to talk as <i>
<b>pleading</b>
</i>, but these foes don’t “care what Peng thinks.” After looking at their current drive—“to get the Iron Seal-Snakes to lose or forfeit their next match”—and balance principle—Subterfuge—the GM decides to just say what happens next. “The masked figures stop coming closer, making clear they’re listening. The one in front says, in a garbled, weird voice, ‘You come with us, and we’ll leave them.’”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Paxton winces. “No, I don’t like that at all …but I’m not sure I see a better option. ‘All right, I’ll go,’ I say.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM arches an eyebrow. “Are you telling the truth? Do you actually mean to go quietly?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“No,” says Paxton. “I’m going to try to escape as soon as I can.” “Okay, that sounds like you’re <i>
<b>tricking </b>
</i>them, then—you want</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">them to buy into this plan and leave your friends alone, but you’re not actually playing along,” the GM says.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, wait—I didn’t want to trigger that move. If I go with them willingly, does that mean I can’t try to escape at all?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Nah—it means you’re going with them ‘in good faith’ for now, but when the situation changes you can always try to escape later. If you want them to believe you’re telling the truth right now, and take some action right this second based on that lie, then you’re <i>
<b>tricking </b>
</i>them,” the GM explains.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, okay…I think I’d prefer not to go with them. So yeah, I want them to pull back, leave my friends alone, but then once they’re up here, I’ll run and try to get to my friends first. I guess I’ll <i>
<b>trick </b>
</i>them,” Paxton says.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Okay, you probably need to sell the trick a bit, too—maybe let them bind your wrists. That cool?” the GM asks, thinking of the fiction and what would make sense for the trick to actually land.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Not at all, but I’ll do it,” says Paxton.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Excellent. One of them steps forward to tie your wrists. Roll with Creativity!” the GM says.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you commit to a course of action that triggers a move, you usually end up rolling dice. You don’t roll dice any other time. If a move calls for dice, roll them and consult the move for what happens next. Sometimes players snap up the dice, ready to charge into action and save the day…but the fiction always comes first, and you have to trigger a move before you roll. Say what you do, then figure out the move that follows.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s fine to think of the move you want to make <i>first </i>and then <i>figure out </i>what fiction you want to use to trigger the move. If you look over your basic moves sheet (see Appendix C) and decide maybe you want to <span class="s8">trick </span>someone, then start thinking of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a distraction or hustle to trigger <span class="s8">trick an NPC</span>—it might take you a moment to decide what trick can work, but you can’t roll the dice until everyone’s on the same page: you have to do the trick in the fiction to get to <span class="s8">trick an NPC </span>and roll the dice!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But not all moves use dice. Some moves—such as <span class="s8">Not Done Yet! </span>
<a href="part72.htm#bookmark144" class="s22">(page 172)</a> or <span class="s8">Fueled by Anger </span>
<a href="part74.htm#bookmark147" class="s22">(page </a>180)—tell you and the GM what happens when they are triggered. No dice rolled.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Hits and Misses</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a move asks you to roll dice, roll <span class="s20">two six-sided dice (2d6)</span>, add the two results together, and follow the outcomes of the move. Traditionally, moves ask you to roll with a stat— like “roll with <span class="s49">Harmony</span>” or “roll with <span class="s49">Passion</span>”—meaning you add that stat to the dice total. A character with <span class="s49">Harmony </span>+2, for example, adds 2 to the total when “rolling with <span class="s49">Harmony</span>,” and a character with <span class="s49">Passion </span>-2 subtracts 2 from the total when “rolling with <span class="s49">Passion</span>.” There are ways to get bonuses—or suffer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">penalties—to your roll, but <span class="s20">you never roll with more than a +4 or less than a -3</span>, no matter what bonuses or penalties you have.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Weak Hits and Strong Hits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Move outcomes are straightforward: anything totaling 7 or more is a <span class="s20">hit</span>, anything totaling 6 or less is a <span class="s20">miss</span>. Some moves give additional options on a 10+ or give you more description for what happens on a 7–9 or miss. Each move is unique, so read the move carefully before you roll the dice to find out what kind of outcomes you might find on the other side of the roll.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In general, a hit means you get what you want; rolling a 7+ on the dice is almost always preferable to rolling a 6 or less. If you’re trying to <span class="s8">trick an NPC</span>, for example, then a 7+ on your roll means they’re fooled, at least for a few moments, probably long enough for you to have a shot at your broader goals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a 7+, you get something, but it’s not always pretty. When you roll a 7–9—a <span class="s20">weak hit</span>—there might be some serious costs or complications, but your roll is not a failure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes those costs are direct—like marking 1-fatigue or incurring some negative consequences alongside your success— but sometimes a 7–9 means you get fewer positive results from the move you just made.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">A 10+ is often described as a <span class="s20">strong hit</span>. If a move tells you to do something on a 10+, it usually means that you get a bonus or strong result, well beyond what you would get if you rolled a 7–9 result.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most of the time, you’re hoping for a 10+ when you pick up the dice and roll, especially if you want to avoid the costs of a weak hit!</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">After more fighting, the top of the building Peng and his op- ponents are standing on is about to come down! Luckily, Teru Jinno is piloting a prototype miniature zeppelin to provide help, with the rest of their companions aboard. Unluckily, they’re not going to be able to get in easy reach before the collapse begins!</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“I run off the roof and leap towards the zeppelin!” Paxton says. “Can I throw myself with earthbending? <i>
<b>Rely on skills and training</b>
</i>?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Well, you can throw yourself, but it’s a desperate, risky gamble— you’re throwing yourself through the air, hoping to get within reach of your friends in a zeppelin a good 30 feet away. This is definitely <i>
<b>pushing your luck</b>
</i>,” says the GM. “Roll with <span class="s49">Passion</span>!”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Paxton does, and he gets a 10+! “According to the move, you do it, but it costs you to scrape by. Also, a lucky opportunity falls into your lap!” says the GM. “Alright, so I think it’s easy</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">to imagine what it costs you—this is utterly terrifying. You’re throwing yourself out into the open air, and you’re not sure you’ll reach anyone who can catch you. Mark Afraid.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah, that makes sense,” says Paxton.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“But then, for the lucky opportunity—one of the masked figures won’t let you go, and chases after you. They get thrown by the wave you push through the ceiling, too, and even as your hand wraps around one of the rods of the zeppelin, they madly wrap their arms onto you! It’s a lot of weight, but you’re pretty strong; more importantly, you can tell they feel that same fear as you. This would be a great time to intimidate them by threat- ening to drop them or something!”</p>

<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But imagine if Paxton had instead rolled a 7–9…</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Paxton rolls and gets a 7–9! “According to the move, you do it, but it costs you to scrape by,” says the GM. “Alright, so I think this takes an enormous amount of effort to pull off, to throw yourself through the air like this, and then catch the zeppelin and pull yourself up. Mark 3-fatigue.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“3-fatigue? Jeez, I only have two blank. I guess I take a condi- tion, too?” says Paxton.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, go ahead and pick. The good news, though, is that by pushing yourself to your absolute limit, you manage to do it and throw yourself right into the zeppelin, leaving your foes behind you!”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A miss isn’t always a failure: it just means the GM tells you what happens. It’s likely your character won’t like what the GM says, since the GM’s job is to push the fiction in interesting directions, but—as a player—you will often find yourself enjoying the way the twist ramps up the tension.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In fact, some of the most interesting misses give you exactly what you wanted but in the worst possible way:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But imagine if, in the last example, Paxton had instead rolled a 6-…</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oof,” says the GM. “Yeah, you try to create a wave of earth across the roof to throw you, but it winds up utterly ripping the roof to pieces. You get chucked, hard, through the air, right at the zeppelin. You smash into the side—go ahead and mark</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">2-fatigue—but more importantly, the whole building starts to collapse with the force of your bending. You watch in horror from the zeppelin as the training building starts to turn into rubble and dust.”</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GM isn’t playing <i>against </i>you, but one of their main jobs is pushing the story forward with dangerous twists and difficult choices! While the focus is always on an interesting story, the GM has to introduce down beats to make the stakes of the story real, to remind you that your misses have real consequences.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They might not be failures, but they will be challenging out- comes that push you to rise above them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM never rolls dice in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Instead, they tell you what’s happening and respond to your actions. If you’re the GM, see <span class="s20">Chapter 8: Running the Game </span>
