<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What If A PC Loses Bending?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Many special circumstances in the Avatarverse en- hance, weaken, or remove different types of bending for a certain amount of time. So, what happens when a bender can’t bend? For most benders it means they can’t fight, i.e., can’t make the <b>stance move</b>, and aren’t able to <b>rely on their skills and training </b>related to bending. Unless they’ve branched out into anoth- er form of training, weapons, or technology, they’re substantially hindered. Many benders rely solely on their bending to accomplish most difficult physical tasks and without it they’re at a loss. They’ll have to <b>push their luck </b>to even try to overcome some ob- stacles, and they might even be <i>Impaired </i>at all things until their bending comes back!</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use an anchor NPC when:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• You want to draw attention to balance as a central theme.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• You want to spotlight one PC and their character arc.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• A complicated situation requires an NPC advocate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An anchor NPC may be someone from a PC’s past, a mentor they’re searching for, or someone wise or powerful they are destined to meet. Your goal with this NPC is to pull on one side of the PC’s track, like an anchor, dragging the character toward one pole of their principle in order to confront them with how that principle affects them. Anchor NPCs engage PCs with aspects of their personality in a blunt and incessant way, repeatedly pushing them to make choices that affect the PC’s balance track.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you’re using an anchor NPC in your game, be careful not to overplay the NPC’s influence. The intention of an anchor NPC is to add fun drama into the game, not to harass a player into portraying their character a certain way. If you find that a PC isn’t interested in engaging with an anchor NPC or grows frustrated with them, it’s a good time for that anchor NPC to exit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Try to limit yourself to one anchor NPC in a session and to focus on a singular character, rather than presenting a differ- ent NPC for each player. These characters are important and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">meeting them should signal some sort of change or progress in a person’s life. Focusing on one PC at a time gives anchor NPCs a chance to have weight and import in the narrative.</p>
