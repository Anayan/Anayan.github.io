<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Tui and La are the Moon and Ocean Spirits that inhabit the Spirit Oasis. Years ago the two of them chose to leave the Spirit World for the mortal one to help humanity and made the Spirit Oasis their home. In the Oasis, Tui took the form of a white koi fish with a black spot on its head, while La turned into a black koi fish with a white spot on its head. Tui has healing powers, and La has the power</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">to drag an enemy into the Fog of Lost Souls, a prison for humans in the Spirit World. During the Hundred Year War, Tui was gravely wounded, but the brave sacrifice of Yue, the Northern Water Tribe princess, restored Tui at the cost of Yue’s own life.</p>

<a name="bookmark28">The Earth Kingdom</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom is gigantic, encompassing all kinds of terrain and peoples, large cities and small villages alike. It is home to numerous cultures, making it distinct from the other nations with its diversity. An <span class="s20">Earth Monarch </span>rules the entire 55-state kingdom from the walled city of Ba Sing Se, but individual regions also have their own local governments. The further away a village is from Ba Sing Se, the more autonomy it enjoys. And since the kingdom is enormous, the outermost villages of the kingdom have been quite autonomous indeed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part14.htm#bookmark24" class="s22">The region’s early history is filled with war between various groups vying for power, as seen in the time of Avatar Wan (page 17)</a> when settlers first fought for control of the territories that eventually became the Earth Kingdom. War has played a major role in the kingdom’s existence ever since. Much of the kingdom was seized by the Fire Nation during the Hundred Year War, including the great city of Omashu, which often vied with Ba Sing Se for political power.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Even after Avatar Aang and his allies brought an end to the Hundred Year War, the Earth Kingdom struggled with the long- term effects of colonization. Other challenges the people of this kingdom have faced throughout nearly every era include pover- ty, organized crime, and corrupt law enforcement and govern- ment. Due to the nation’s size, it’s hard to generalize its peoples, aside to say they’re as diverse as the world itself.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A sprawling city rife with corruption protected by an impenetrable wall <span class="p">Ba Sing Se is the capital of the Earth Kingdom, situated in the northeast of the continent. It is the largest city in the world, the seat of power for the Earth Kingdom, and self-sufficient, with farms, a lake, and many local industries. Ba Sing Se is also one of the oldest cities in the world, dating back thousands of years. Ba Sing Se is home to the impressive Ba Sing Se University in the Middle Ring, which offers many different courses of study.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The city is divided into several rings separated by giant walls.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">From outermost ring to innermost, there is:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• The defensive Outer Wall</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• The Agrarian Zone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• The defensive Inner Wall</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• The Lower Ring, where the poorer citizens live</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• The Middle Ring, where the middle-class citizens live</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Upper Ring with the Royal Palace and where the wealthiest citizens live alongside military and government officials</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The class differences between the rings of Ba Sing Se are built into the very structure of the city. Of all the rings, the Lower Ring is the most densely populated with rampant poverty and criminal activity. Those who want to travel around Ba Sing Se may run into some challenges depending on their class and per- ceived importance: residents of the Upper Ring may go where they please within Ba Sing Se; residents of the Middle Ring may travel anywhere freely except the Upper Ring; and residents of the Lower Ring may not travel to the Middle or Upper Rings without a passport.</p>

<a name="bookmark29">Omashu</a>
</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A mountain-top city with unique technology operated by bending <span class="p">Omashu is the second largest city in the Earth Kingdom after Ba Sing Se. An impressive sight, it stands in the southwest of the Earth Kingdom high atop a mountain within the Kolau Moun- tain Range. Legend has it that the city was founded to honor the tragic lovers Oma and Shu who carried on a forbidden romance</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">despite hailing from warring villages. According to the story, Shu died in battle between the villages, and in her grief, Oma enacted an amazing feat of earthbending that could have destroyed both settlements. Instead, she declared the war over, and the two populations merged to create the city of Omashu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The city’s most unusual feature is its mail delivery system.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This intricate system is a network of large chutes partly operated by earthbending. Omashu is also known for innovation and technological progress; its inventors see technology and bending as working hand in hand. Due to its size, importance, and unique innovations, Omashu has always competed with Ba Sing Se for prominence in the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Si Wong Desert</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A vast and deadly desert</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The beautiful and deadly Si Wong Desert lies near the center of the Earth Kingdom. Crossing it is all but impossible, especially for those unfamiliar with the sheer size of the desert and its un- forgiving environment. The Si Wong Tribes who live in the area are masters of survival. The oldest of these tribes are the bee-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tle-headed merchants, prolific traders who ride giant rhinoceros beetles and have settlements throughout the desert.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those who wish to travel across the Si Wong Desert should do well to find a guide and stock up on supplies and information about the area. The best place to do this is at the Misty Palms Oasis to the southwest. The beetle-headed merchants make</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a point of visiting the oasis frequently to conduct business. A mysterious iceberg with spiritual properties sits in the center of the town, supplying water and mist.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kyoshi Island</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A large island home to the renowned Kyoshi Warriors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part22.htm#bookmark36" class="s22">Before Avatar Kyoshi (page 32)</a> faced off against Chin the Conqueror, Kyoshi Island was physically part of the Yokoya Peninsula. Kyoshi had long guarded the independence and self-sufficiency of her homeland. She founded an all-female</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">military order known as the Kyoshi Warriors, who evolved from a self-defense organization for local women to elite protectors of the isolated region. When Chin the Conqueror attempted</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to take the peninsula by force, she tore it from the continent, creating the island it is today.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kyoshi Island and the Kyoshi Warriors have continued to hold importance throughout the eras. The island serves as a home and training ground to these amazing martial artists renowned the world over for their fighting style and skill with metal battle fans. Avatar Aang inspired the Warriors to back the Earth Kingdom’s efforts during the Hundred Year War, and after that a group of the warriors went on to serve as Fire Lord Zuko’s bodyguards.</p>
