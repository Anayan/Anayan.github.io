</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">You’ll notice King Kuei is absent from our list of notable figures. If you want to deal with the Earth King during the Hundred Year War Era, you’re actually dealing with Long Feng. King Kuei is the 52<span class="s47">nd </span>Earth King, and while he has technically been on the throne since he was four years old, he does not actually do much ruling. Grand Secretariat Long Feng has made all decisions on his behalf since Kuei was a child, and the king doesn’t much mind it since he has no idea that there is a war going on. In fact, King Kuei has never even left the premises of the Royal Palace. Right now, King Kuei’s main concerns are keeping himself amused, growing his menagerie, throwing parties, and pampering his best friend, a pet bear named Bosco.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jet and the Freedom Fighters</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of rebels determined to destroy the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Freedom Fighters are a group of young Earth Kingdom refugees ostensibly dedicated to protecting the Earth Kingdom. This means ridding the world of any and all Fire Nation citizens that cross their path—the Fighters’ mission of protection often becoming one of vengeance. Though composed entirely of kids, the group stands their own against trained Fire Army soldiers and ambushes their troops to cut off their supply lines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark60" class="s22">Led by a charismatic and manipulative boy named Jet whose parents were murdered by the Rough Rhinos (page 65),</a> the Freedom Fighters include Smellerbee, Longshot, Pipsqueak, the Duke, Sneers, and several others who have joined them over time. Their secret base is located in a network of treehouses obscured by foliage in the woods near a western Earth Kingdom village, Gaipan. The fighters take their lead from Jet, who is ruthless in his quest to destroy the Fire Nation. He is the most willing to kill defenseless Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom civil- ians alike if it brings down the Fire Army as well.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Mechanist</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A brilliant inventor in servitude to the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part18.htm#bookmark31" class="s22">The Mechanist is an Earth Kingdom refugee living in the North- ern Air Temple (page 26)</a> with a number of other refugees, including his son, Teo. Before coming to the temple, his village was destroyed by a flood that killed his wife and paralyzed his son from the waist down. Along with the other survivors, the Mecha- nist discovered the Northern Air Temple, where they still reside.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a genius inventor, the Mechanist was inspired by the tem- ple and the Airbenders who once lived there. He built gliders that allowed his people to fly, including a chair glider for Teo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the group first lived there in secret, the Fire Nation dis- covered them and coerced the Mechanist into building weapons for the Fire Nation. Though the Mechanist hates helping the Fire Nation, he creates new inventions for their war effort, knowing that the other refugees and his son would suffer if he refused.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There Is No War in Ba Sing Se</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Survival and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Dai Li have a secret underground base they use to brainwash Earth Kingdom dissidents. If anyone discovers the seriousness of the war outside of Ba Sing Se, if any refugee dares speak of what’s outside the city’s walls, or if someone rises to enough prominence and causes trouble for the Dai Li—they’re sent away to be “re-educated” under Lake Laogai. Likewise, a person who makes enemies out of Long Feng might find themselves captured by the Dai Li and brought to the base. During the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">re-education process, victims are forced to look at a bright flashing light while the phrase “there is no war in Ba Sing Se” is repeated by a Dai Li agent. Once brainwashed into forgetting about the war, the person is released back into their old life.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corruption in Ba Sing Se</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Morals Being Tested</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng isn’t the only nefarious authority figure in Ba Sing Se. There are also lesser government officials equally as corrupt. These politicians wield no small amount of local power, which they abuse as the mood strikes them. Politics in Ba Sing Se is a viper’s nest rife with danger; sometimes government officials conspire together to take down a joint rival, and sometimes they compete with each other to better their own political position through back-stabbing. However, these tenuous ties between people in power can also work in the heroes’ favor—perhaps one of the Council of Five could be convinced to work against Long Feng’s orders or a government official could be bribed to do the right thing; either way, someone meddling in politics should tread carefully, because the citizens of the Earth King- dom have internalized that it’s always the common people who suffer the most and pay the price for the corruption in the city.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Nation Colonies</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Colonization in Progress</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tensions are high in regions of the Earth Kingdom where Fire Nation colonists and Earth Kingdom civilians live side by side. Though some communities have merged over time like the city of Yu Dao where Earth Kingdom locals and Fire Nation colo- nists created new families together, it hardly means peaceful rela- tions. Some Earth Kingdom civilians resent their colonizer fam- ily members, friends, and neighbors who they view as foreign, despising other Earth Kingdom citizens who’ve embraced them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For others, a merged life is the only one they’ve ever known and they’ve built their whole lives upon that foundation. Those unhappy with the current arrangement, no matter their origin, find ways to make life unbearable for their neighbors under the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nose of Fire Nation troops—they sabotage crops, socially isolate families, and refuse to trade with anyone they see as “other.”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark60" class="s22">The Fire Nation has experienced a recent shift in leadership after the secret assassination of Fire Lord Azulon. Though Iroh (page 65)</a> was meant to take the throne after his father’s passing,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ozai orchestrated events so that he became Fire Lord instead. Ozai is just as set on world domination as his father and grandfa- ther before him and has sent out his son, Prince Zuko, with the help of Iroh, to hunt down the Avatar. The prince is forbidden to return home until he completes his mission.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now more than ever, the Fire Nation heavily prioritizes its military and industrial power. Its navy and its army have never been stronger, and they occupy much of the Earth Kingdom. There are no signs that Fire Lord Ozai and his military plan to stop their cruel campaigns, and the fates of the Air Nomads and Southern Water Tribe serve as tragic reminders of just what</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Fire Nation is capable of. Much of this history and truth of current events is kept silent within the Fire Islands themselves, where children only learn the glorious history of their country, which paints the Air Nomads as aggressors and the Fire Nation as the peoples who lift other nations up from poverty and chaos. A new generation of Fire Nation citizens have grown up on the lies of the crown, ignorant of what’s really happening outside their borders other than the propaganda they’re regularly fed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While some citizens do not agree with what their nation is doing, a few of them dare to stand against the government, though certainly not openly. To do so would lead to being</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">branded as a traitor and thrown in prison, or worse. People who wish to rebel against Ozai and his government do so in secret, but some objectives cannot be accomplished silently.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Ozai</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The merciless leader of the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ozai was not first in line to become Fire Lord, though he desper- ately longed for the throne and resented his older brother Iroh’s claim to it. Now that Ozai has the throne, he uses his authority to aggressively further the Fire Nation’s century-long quest for world domination. Since taking power, Ozai has spent most of his time ruling from the Royal Palace and surrounding area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ozai is ruthless in matters of revenge, power, and politics. This cruelty is no more evident than how he treats his own family—Ozai is responsible for permanently scarring his son Zuko by burning him on the face, and Ozai threatened his wife by suggesting he would murder Zuko, before she bargained</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for her son’s life and was secretly exiled. He sentences people to exile without a second thought and sends assassins to kill those whose existence merely bothers him. If his citizens create</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">obstacles to his agenda, he does not hesitate to make an example of them. He expects full and undying loyalty from all his subjects and frequently tests that loyalty, even using his servants to spy on his family.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Azula</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A power-hungry member of the Fire Nation royal family</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Azula is the heir to the throne and an adept Firebender known first and foremost for her cruelty and desire for power. As her father’s favorite child, she spends most of her time at the Royal Palace and is an ambitious perfectionist who emulates him in many ways. Azula is as calculating as she is lethal with her firebending powers, which include the ability to lightningbend, and she knows exactly how to manipulate someone’s emotions to make them vulnerable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Azula rarely deems anyone worthy of her time unless they can further her goal of impressing her father. Her two closest friends are Ty Lee and Mai, whom she met at the Royal Fire Academy for Girls. The two friends are very different from Azula; Ty Lee is very upbeat and friendly and Mai comes across as apathetic and gloomy. Even as Azula’s best friends, the two girls aren’t spared her wrath, but they remain loyal to the princess…for now.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commander Zhao</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An ambitious Fire Navy commander bent on climbing to the top <span class="p">Zhao is the commander of a Fire Navy fleet, steadily climbing the ladder of power. He learned firebending from Jeong Jeong before the admiral defected, but only cares for its destructive power rath- er than finding balance and precision through mental discipline.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part16.htm#bookmark29" class="s22">Zhao has an incredible advantage over his rivals; some time ago, he used the Spirit Library in the Si Wong Desert (page 23)</a> to learn the Water Tribes’ weaknesses. He then burned down the section of the library dedicated to the Fire Nation so that no one could learn about the Fire Nation’s vulnerabilities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zhao has enemies and rivals even within the Fire Nation as evidenced by his loathing of Prince Zuko. If someone has insider knowledge about one of his opponents, he turns on the charm and tries to procure it. Should that not work, he is more than happy to use violent measures to acquire that knowledge instead.</p>

Now that the War Minister has gotten a taste of true ingenuity, Qin’s hunger for innovation is greater than ever. Anyone who has a piece of new technology is in danger of attracting his attention, and he will gladly blackmail innocents in order to take it for himself.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeong Jeong</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A legendary firebending Fire Navy defector</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part20.htm#bookmark34" class="s22">Jeong Jeong is an ex-Fire Nation admiral and a firebending teach- er who has become something of a legend. When he defected, he moved to the Earth Kingdom where he now travels with a small tribe of followers. He is an incredibly skilled Firebender who is fully aware of firebending’s destructive potential and how it can be used to devastating effect. He has sworn never to teach firebending again after seeing students use his teachings toward gruesome ends. Zhao is the most destructive of those students, and he looks down on his former teacher for turning his back on the Fire Nation. Jeong Jeong is also a reclusive member of the Order of the White Lotus (page 30).</a> He can be difficult to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">track down since he never stays in one place for long for fear of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">being captured by the Fire Nation.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chey</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A cheerful Fire Nation defector with explosives skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chey is an ex-Fire Nation captain who questioned using his explo- sives expertise to destroy Earth Kingdom villages and defected.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He reveres Jeong Jeong and uses his expertise to thwart the Fire Nation rather than serving it. Chey dutifully follows his mentor everywhere he goes and practically worships the older deserter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Chey is much more outgoing and hopeful than Jeong Jeong, which is a source of tension between the two. Chey believes he can still actively make the world a better place. He is more than willing to lend out his skills if it means protecting the innocent.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of mercenaries who attack the vulnerable</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Rough Rhinos are an elite group of Fire Nation soldiers who ride komodo-rhinos led by a Firebender called Colonel Mongke. The Colonel’s ruthless, intelligent nature makes him exceedingly dangerous. Where other leaders may care about their soldiers, Mongke only cares about himself and isn’t afraid to lose some people if it means he survives. Anyone unlucky enough to encoun- ter this group of soldiers has a nasty fight on their hands, as the Rough Rhinos are known for their brutality. If anyone stands in defense of a vulnerable Earth Kingdom village the Rough Rhinos target, Colonel Mongke takes it as a personal challenge and won’t rest until that village lies in ruins.</p>
