<p class="s12" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GM’s Role</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, you look at the story from within and without, describ- ing the conflicts, institutions, and non-player characters (NPCs),</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">as well as the broader environment and narrative. You tell the other players the time of day, where the escaped princes are hiding, what techniques the enemy soldiers use. You speed up the action when a fight drags, throw in a secret lover to spice up the story, and add a tricky, moral choice to make the other players squirm and think.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In order to manage everything you need to balance your work, you rely on the core GMing mechanics for <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game</span>—your agendas, baselines, guidelines, and moves:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Your <span class="s20">agendas </span>are your goals as a GM. You should broadly aim for these things during play, ideas that bring the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">game to life and make it fun for everyone at the table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Your <span class="s20">baselines </span>are your “always say” rules. Whatever you say as a GM, you should always strive to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">remain within the boundaries of these rules.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Your <span class="s20">guidelines </span>are how you arrive at your agendas. They’re the roads you travel down to capture that Avatarverse feel, principles to remember whenever you describe anything. At any moment, at least one set of guidelines should apply.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Your <span class="s20">GM moves </span>are actions you, as a GM, take to respond to the players, specific things you can say in the game’s conversation to directly affect the story and characters.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rest of this chapter works to help you master these mechanics, featuring sections on each core element of GMing, then exploring tools you can use for creating and portraying NPCs, managing bending and training, and running effective fight scenes.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">But What Does a GM Do?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rest of this chapter tells you how to run <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, but it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on what your actual jobs are while you’re running the game. Your tasks are varied, but they fall into a few big categories:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Portray the rest of the world</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As GM, you describe the companions’ surroundings and the people they meet. You describe what NPCs—every other character in the game who’s not a player character—look like, say, and do. Players ask you questions about the world; it’s your job to answer those questions, or even turn it back on the players and ask <i>them </i>to come up with an answer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Don’t worry too much about poetic descriptions or “au- thentic” acting on the part of the NPCs. Play in whatever way you find comfortable. You aren’t solely responsible for making the session fun or interesting—every player contributes to the story and your shared experience—so focus on representing the characters and situations clearly. A clear NPC who professes a relatively straightforward set of interesting conflicts is always more moving than a mysterious stranger who does things for reasons no one understands!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, it’s your job to keep track of and represent the over- arching plots, storylines, and events of the broader world. A game of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>that includes <i>no </i>underlying plans from major powers, institutions, or forces, where PCs simply act and the world simply reacts, gets stale fast. It’s your duty to come up with and manage these larger schemes within the world, and it’s your job to decide how things resolve “off-screen” when the PCs can’t be around to act. Often, this includes adjudicating conflicts that are too big for the heroes to resolve directly, like “Which army triumphs in a battle in a larger war?” or “Who wins an election in this Earth Kingdom province?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But most importantly…you decide when dangers arise. The companions are unlikely to say something like, “Oh, we see some bandits on the road, don’t we?” It’s your job to introduce these sorts of dangers and to make them feel real and meaningful to the players when they arise. Obstacles, conflicts, and problems are the main sources of drama in <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories, and you’ve got</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to make sure that your game features plenty of issues for the com- panions to address. After all, they can’t be heroes unless they have a chance to right great wrongs and have fantastic adventures!</p>

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Adjudicate the rules</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Arbitrating the rules of the game falls to you. Does a specific ac- tion fall under the purview of a PC’s training? Can a character’s bending abilities stretch as far as their player describes? While you might discuss such questions with the players, for the sake of moving the game forward, the ultimate decision falls to you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In particular, you say when a player has triggered a move. The other players fictionally describe what their characters do, and it falls to you to decide which move they trigger (if any). Some- times a player tells you that they’re trying to trigger a specific move, but it’s still down to you to help them match their actions in the fiction to the move they’re triggering.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If a PC wants to do something uncertain, risky, or dangerous and there’s no clear move, chances are they’re <span class="s8">pushing their luck</span>. If you don’t think there’s any uncertainty to resolve—the action’s impossible even by <span class="s8">pushing their luck</span>, or there’s no need for a move because there’s no doubt about what happens next—then you just say what happens.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, if a player says they want their PC to shoot down the moon, that’s almost certainly impossible—just say what happens. If they want to bake some delicious bao, there probably is no uncertainty—but if they’re using the bao to do something else, then there could be. Try and determine the in- tent of the action. Are they <span class="s8">intimidating </span>a rival baker? Using the bao as a bribe to <span class="s8">plead </span>for someone to be set free? <span class="s8">Guiding and comforting </span>a friend via baked deliciousness? Use the appropriate moves in each case. If no move comes to mind—if there is no uncertainty—then they simply bake delicious bao!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">This is extra important when it comes to mysteries and hunt- ing for clues. <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is not designed for complex, Sherlock-Holmes-style mystery-solving. There’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">no “search for clues” move. If the companions want to look for clues, then either use a move to resolve the uncertainty—<span class="s8">assess a situation </span>might do the trick, or they might have some playbook moves—or simply tell them everything they find.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Make sure you’re well acquainted with all the moves that players are likely to use—check out <span class="s20">Chapter 3: Fundamentals of Play </span>and <span class="s20">Chapter 5: Core Moves </span>for that information.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Encourage everyone to participate</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The game is only fun when <i>everyone </i>is having fun. As GM, make it a point to check in often with other players to make sure everyone’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part11.htm#bookmark10" class="s22">having a good time. Encourage them to use their safety tools to help steer the game in a direction where everyone is enjoying themselves. Watch for players who look uncomfortable: it might be a good idea to check in with them. See more on safety tools on page 12.</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While it’s everyone’s job to look out for each other, you as GM have a responsibility to model table etiquette and encour- age others to voice concerns. If people aren’t taking the safety tools seriously, make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable; if people talk over each other, step in and make sure everyone has time to contribute to the story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">All of this might sound like a tall order, but don’t worry! A lot of it comes naturally, and the other players will help (whether consciously or not). After all, in the Avatarverse, those telling a tale tend to end up inextricably bound to it.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Provide structure and coherence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roleplaying games are, by definition, a bit chaotic. No one knows exactly where the story is going to go, and things tend to change even when you think you’ve got them planned out in full. You’re effectively telling a story with multiple narrators,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">each adding a new direction to the conversation each time they take an action in the fiction!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, it’s your job to help bring all those chaotic contri- butions into alignment; you decide when scenes start and end, which NPCs show up on-screen, and which plot threads get brought up again and again! It’s not up to you to determine how the story goes—the players get to make their own decisions about what their PCs do and what they care about—but it’s your job to help knit all their actions and decisions and mistakes and problems together into a story. You’re the one that needs to track what the antagonists are plotting, what decisions the PCs made last session, and how the rest of the world reacts to the companions and their heroic exploits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The players will sometimes remind you about an NPC you’ve forgotten or a plot thread that got dropped three sessions ago.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That’s great! But they are still looking <i>to you </i>to answer what happened to that element of the world, especially if the question revolves around an NPC they care about—<i>“Wasn’t he going to find someone to help with the refugees?” </i>It’s still up to you to help the group understand how those NPCs and plot threads matter to them, to help them understand why their actions had conse- quences and what those consequences were in the fictional world. Sometimes this means telling them directly what happened—“Yeah! Let’s say he got word</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to you about the new homes he’s found and things are working out okay…”— and sometimes it means leaving</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gaps and mysteries for the PCs to explore—“That’s weird you haven’t heard from him, right? Maybe you should check it out…”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This part of your role becomes more important as you include more and more sessions in your campaign, as the world of your story gets larger and larger.</p>
