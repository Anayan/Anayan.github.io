<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In terms of how NPCs <i>behave</i>, here are a few guidelines to make your characters more three-dimensional:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Look to your <span class="s20">agendas, guidelines, and moves </span>to determine how they act. In particular, remember that there’s no such thing as pure evil.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Use the <span class="s20">NPCs’ drives </span>to determine what they want and how they get it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Use any <span class="s20">conditions </span>marked on them to determine their emotional state and to modify their actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Use their <span class="s20">principle </span>and their <span class="s20">current balance </span>to determine how committed they are to their ideals—the higher the principle, the more obsessive they grow, and the less open they are to changing their mind. It might be possible to get them to change how they act by <span class="s8">calling them out </span>and appealing to their deep investment in their principle, but <span class="s8">pleading </span>with them, <span class="s8">intimidating </span>them, or <span class="s8">guiding and comforting </span>them in ways that conflict with their principle all become more and more difficult.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• If appropriate, you can <i>inflict fatigue or conditions </i>on an NPC or <i>shift their balance </i>based on the fiction. If they become dramatically Angry or become highly committed to their principle, note this down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• If they <span class="s20">mark a condition </span>or <span class="s20">shift their balance </span>while</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“on-screen,” make them react—have them take action that shows the change. This works even in combat—the NPC can react between exchanges, or might alter the goal they have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the fight (thus picking new approaches or techniques). If an NPC winds up marking multiple conditions rapidly, it’s often simplest to choose a dominant one and play to that…or to play up how rapidly stressed out they are, suddenly filled with conflicting and dramatic emotions!</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">NPCs In Combat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Companions will inevitably fight NPCs. How the fight turns out depends on the NPCs’ importance and the decisions the PCs make during the conflict.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Minor NPCs </span>are “mooks,” “henchpeople,” of middling importance. They get tossed around easily and make the companions look cool by losing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They showcase how awesome the companions are given their training and techniques.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Major NPCs </span>are capable, challenging obstacles. Defeating them shouldn’t take too long, but they might escape (perhaps even before defeat, if they feel they’re losing) and return later—with a vengeance!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Master NPCs </span>are clever, motivated people with their own goals and principles—they rarely risk their lives foolishly and gladly flee if the chips are down. Unlike major NPCs, their motivation for escape tends not to be out of fear, but out of a desire to return better prepared.</p>
