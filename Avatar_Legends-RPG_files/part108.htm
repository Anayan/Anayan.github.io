<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-Shots</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Maybe your group is just trying out the system or you’re running a special session of the game at a convention for people who can’t get together a second time. In those and similar cases, rather than create a whole campaign, you might decide to only run a single session of <span class="s56">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game</span>. In addition to preparing an adventure, here are a few tips for making a one-shot of the game awesome:</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TIE EVERYTHING TOGETHER</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Look for every opportunity to tie things together, both during the game and in character creation. Is the Hammer’s adversary the same character who caused the Idealist’s tragedy? Is the Successor’s family the reason the Pillar’s squad temporarily dis- banded? You’ve only one chance to make the play- ers care about the fictional world you’re creating together, so do everything you can to link up their stories—and the consequences of their actions— into one cohesive whole. It’s a lot more satisfying for two characters to address their stories together than for one of them to have all the spotlight.</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MAKE THE STORY CINEMATIC</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">
<a href="part96.htm#bookmark186" class="s25">Think of your session less like the pilot episode of a new show and more like an Avatarverse feature film. Make harder moves (page </a>229) and bring the consequences to a head early and often. You don’t</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">have time to wait for a plot to develop or for a rela- tionship to blossom; bring the heat right away so the PCs can actually resolve the big issues at play! Shoot for resolving the group’s focus—escorting an NPC, defeating a villain, etc.—by the end of the session!</p>
<p class="s38" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">START WITH THE ACTION</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Above all else, start your players in the middle of the action, narratively and mechanically. Frame scenes in which the companions are already in a heap of trou- ble—in which their plans have gone awry but there’s still a chance they can save the day—or put NPCs they care about in harm’s way. Don’t be subtle with your moves or your NPC’s plots! Think like Varrick— his movers always open with action so exciting the public can’t help but watch!</p>
