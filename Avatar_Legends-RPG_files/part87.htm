</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are some forms of bending that are so specialized only a small subsection of benders can even perform them. Earth- benders can all bend rocks, but even in the Korra Era, not all</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Earthbenders can also bend metal. Waterbenders can all bend a stream, but only a small, small portion of them have the training and the aptitude to bloodbend (thank goodness!).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These specialized bending forms aren’t unique abilities, gifted only to a few special characters, but they are extremely difficult to master. In many cases, some benders find so little aptitude for a given form—like metalbending—that they are unable to ever learn to do it. In most cases, however, these specialized forms are an ex- pansion of the bender’s natural abilities, not new abilities altogether.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Example Specialized Bending Forms:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Bloodbending </b>(from waterbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Combustionbending </b>(from firebending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Energybending</b>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Healing </b>(from waterbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Flight </b>(from airbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Lavabending </b>(from earthbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Lightningbending </b>(from firebending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Metalbending </b>(from earthbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Seismic sense </b>(from earthbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Spiritbending </b>(from waterbending)</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Spiritual projection </b>(from airbending)</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Known Specialized Forms</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The benders who master specialized forms are often cautious about who they train and teach, fearing that the techniques they might help their students master would do more harm than good. After all, very few people can “take away” the knowledge a teacher would bestow on a student! That said, here are a few techniques that show up in <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bloodbending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Waterbenders who have mastered bloodbending can bend the water inside a target’s blood, contorting their limbs, cutting off circulation, or even forcing a target to move in a particular way. In most cases, bloodbending requires something to boost the Waterbender’s abilities, such as a full moon.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Combustionbending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Firebenders who have mastered combustionbending channel a flow of chi from a focus—often a third-eye tattoo on their fore- head—into a beam of energy which explodes on contact.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Healing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Waterbenders who have mastered healing use water to redirect and concentrate energy within a person, greatly accelerating their target’s natural healing ability.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Lavabending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earthbenders who have mastered lavabending can change the phase of earth from a solid to a liquid (magma) and back again, as well as control earth in both solid and liquid forms.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Lightningbending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Firebenders who have mastered lightningbending are able to separate negative and positive energies, bringing them together again in a furious surge of electricity. Some of these benders also have the ability to channel and redirect lightning.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Metalbending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earthbenders who have mastered metalbending can shape and manipulate metal by bending the unrefined earth inside the metal. Completely refined metal (platinum) cannot be bent in this way.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Seismic Sense</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earthbenders who have mastered seismic sense can use vibra- tions in the ground to “see” the surrounding area, including anything within or touching the ground. It is common for a bender to strike the ground before using this ability to maximize the specialized form’s effectiveness.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Spiritbending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Waterbenders who have mastered spiritbending use water to redi- rect and alter the flow of energy within a spirit, pushing the spirit toward balance (or imbalance) by adjusting their internal state.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Developing Specialized Bending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PCs can have access to these specialized forms of bending, as appropriate to their training. In general, the rules for becoming a bender with a specialty are:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• You must successfully learn a technique of that specialty to prove you have the aptitude for it at all.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• You must master a technique of that specialty to be able to use the specialty as easily as the rest of your training.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Earthbender PC who learns a metalbending technique has proved they have the aptitude to metalbend, but they can’t yet use metalbending as easily as their earthbending. They can’t use metalbending to <span class="s8">rely on their skills and training</span>, or <span class="s8">push their luck</span>, or for their basic combat techniques.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">An Earthbender PC who masters a metalbending technique can now use metalbending as easily as their earthbending, including for all the basic moves and the basic combat techniques. When they use Strike, they can hurl a spinning disc of metal at foes; when they use Seize a Position, they can use their metalbending to shoot out a metal grappling line and swing into the air.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At character creation, a PC always gets one mastered technique to start. If a player wants to make sure their PC starts play with a specialized form, they can take a technique of a specialized form— an Earthbender PC who starts play with a mastered metalbending technique has mastered the ability to bend metal!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Alternatively, if you’re playing a longer campaign, a PC might start play with one learned technique to start. If a player wants to make sure their PC has the aptitude to learn a specialized form, they can take a technique of a specialized form at the learned lev- el. They can eventually master that technique and the specialized form of bending at the same time!</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">A PC can also try to learn a specialized form of bending during play, just by using the regular training move above to study a technique of the appropriate specialized form of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bending. For example, an Earthbender PC could study with a metalbending teacher to learn a metalbending technique.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the PC tries to learn a technique from a specialized bending form they don’t already know, it is definitely not <i>“easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, and skills,” </i>so the PC is guaranteed to take at least a -1 from that question for the training move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Using the training move to learn a specialized bending form has one other significant change—when you try to learn a technique from a particular specialized bending form for the first time and you roll a miss, you lack the aptitude for that special- ized bending form. You cannot learn that technique as normal, not even with a new teacher or a particular task set to you. For example, an Earthbender PC who rolls a miss while trying to learn a metalbending technique for the first time simply lacks the aptitude for metalbending—they can’t learn the technique, or any other metalbending technique.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">A PC who has already proved their aptitude for a specialized form of bending treats a miss as normal on the training move to learn a new technique of that specialized form. For example, a PC who already has learned a metalbending technique and is trying to learn a second metalbending technique would treat a miss on the training move as normal—they’ve already proved they have the aptitude to metalbend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can find techniques tied to these specialized forms of bending—as well as a full list of all advanced techniques— in <span class="s20">Appendix A: Techniques</span>.</p>
