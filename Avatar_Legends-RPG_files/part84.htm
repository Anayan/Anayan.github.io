<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to growth advancements, every PC in <span class="s10">Avatar Leg- ends: The Roleplaying Game </span>can improve themselves in another way—by learning and mastering new advanced techniques. Learning advanced techniques represents a character’s skills growing, as they become capable of performing new and impressive feats consistently within combat and more powerful and dynamic uses of their training in general.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">All player characters start play with all nine basic techniques mastered. In fact, every fighter in this game has mastered all nine basic techniques, based on their training. Any NPC who doesn’t have all nine basic techniques mastered is not a trained fighter</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at the level of most in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, but might be a student or an ordinary citizen who doesn’t have much cause to practice their bending in combat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Advanced techniques, on the other hand, are more sophis- ticated, more complicated, and often more powerful than</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">basic techniques. They represent complex, specific sequences of movements and corresponding states of mind and will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any Firebender can conjure a fire, and likely blast a fireball; but only some Firebenders are trained in creating the dread- ed fire pinwheel!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Learning Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a PC learns techniques in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, they always learn advanced techniques. A player character first gains an advanced technique at <span class="s20">learned </span>level, then improves it to <span class="s20">practiced </span>level, and finally to <span class="s20">mastered </span>level:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Learned </span>techniques: the PC has learned the basics and can replicate this technique some of the time. They still need practice and additional understanding to really master this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Practiced </span>techniques: the PC has learned and successfully applied the technique in a stressful combat situation. They have a greater ability to call upon it with ease and efficacy, but have yet to fully master</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">it; they still can’t call upon the technique at will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Mastered </span>techniques: the PC has gained full control and can perform the technique at will, consistently, every time, without question, just like the basic techniques. To master a technique, the PC must fulfill a <span class="s20">mastery condition</span>, some special task set to them by their teacher (often when the character first learns the technique, but sometimes set much later).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mastering a new technique is often an important part of your character’s journey; it might prompt them to seek out a teacher and contend with new and difficult challenges. For example, Sokka’s desire to master the sword led him to study under Piand- ao, a master swordsman from the Fire Nation who challenged the young Sokka to grow considerably in both his sword training and his strategic thinking. Training allows your character to be guided in this journey, mastering new techniques under the eyes of a watchful teacher and mentor.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Types of Advanced Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The full list of advanced techniques can be found in <span class="s20">Appendix A: Techniques</span>. Within that broader list of techniques, there are a few different types:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Universal Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any technique that can be learned by all characters, regardless of training, is a <span class="s20">universal technique</span>. These techniques tend to focus on broad strategies during a combat exchange, such as</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">charging an opponent or protecting an ally. All trainings that are not universal are keyed to a specific training, such as waterbend- ing techniques or technology techniques—they can only be learned by a character with that particular training.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">NPCs without highly distinctive fighting styles usually use universal techniques, but remember that they always make use of their training—an Earthbender who uses a universal tech- nique in a combat exchange is still using earthbending.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Group Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part98.htm#bookmark190" class="s22">Some techniques can only appear when used by groups of NPCs (page 237);</a> these are <span class="s20">group techniques</span>. PCs can never learn group techniques—even if they fight as a group, each individual PC still retains their ability to act independently and choose their own techniques—so these techniques are only for the GM to use when designing group NPCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can expect virtually all group NPCs to feature at least one group technique. These techniques are specifically created to help the GM represent a group fighting together, swarming their opponents to try to get the upper hand or scattering and withdrawing to avoid the PCs’ blows.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Rare Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Techniques that are particularly powerful and potent are often <span class="s20">rare techniques</span>, closely guarded secrets that masters only share with their most trusted students. Such techniques are notably more powerful than other techniques; learning them often requires a student to build a relationship with the master and mastering them often requires considerably more work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">NPCs who have mastered rare techniques are, well, rare. But they are also the only NPCs who can serve as teachers for these potent abilities.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Specialized Bending Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, some <span class="s20">specialized bending techniques </span>require charac- ters to have mastered specialized forms of bending—like healing or lightningbending—in order to learn them. Each of these techniques is marked with the specialized bending form, such</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part87.htm#bookmark168" class="s22">as “lavabending” or “metalbending.” You can read more about learning and mastering specialized bending forms on page 216.</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In early eras, many forms of specialized bending are virtually nonexistant, but later eras feature many characters who have mastered metalbending, lightningbending, lavabending, and more. While NPCs who have mastered these techniques are always potent foes, you can expect their rarity to be directly related to the era you’ve chosen for your game.</p>

<a name="bookmark165">Training &amp; Techniques</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you want to learn a new technique, first you need some way to do so. Some playbooks have special ways to learn tech- niques (like the Prodigy), but most need a teacher, someone who has already mastered the technique and is willing and capable of teaching it. Player characters can’t, in general, teach each other techniques, even if they’ve mastered them; they are still finding themselves and seeking balance, so they aren’t ready to be teachers yet. They have to find teachers out in the world, be they local craftspeople who have mastered some specific use of firebending, or the greatest swordswoman in the entire world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember that you can only learn techniques appropriate for your own training, by default. Some playbooks have ways to get around this, but most Firebenders can only learn techniques that are either universal or specific to firebending, for example. It doesn’t help a Firebender to learn how to create walls of ice!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Your teacher must have mastered the technique they’re teaching you. Mechanically, this means that you aren’t going to be taught by a student, someone who’s still learning—they’re liable to impart the wrong lessons. But within the game, masters abound! The local Waterbender angler likely has mastered tech- niques to aid in her day-to-day job, but those techniques are still valuable to learn and quite possibly effective in a fight—so she’d be a great master!</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you find a teacher who knows the technique and agrees to teach you, then you can use the following move.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Training Move</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you spend time with a teacher learning and training in a new technique, roll with modifiers from the following questions:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of conditions? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Do you and your teacher share at least one background? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training and learning? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, and skills? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a hit, you learn the technique, and your master shifts your balance. On a 10+, you learn it with ease, and it takes as little time as possible. On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark two conditions. On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need another lesson before you can grasp its full use. Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, and you learn the technique.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Basic Elements of the Training Move</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Spend time with a teacher learning and training in a new tech- nique” <span class="p">means that you must both have a teacher, and you must have time. You can’t learn a technique in the middle of combat (without special moves). The amount of time may vary, especially based on the results of the move, but a good rule of thumb is to expect at least half a day, if not more. Furthermore, you need to have the teacher’s attention for a significant por- tion of that time; training is more than just a quick lesson and a day of practice on your own.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you roll, you don’t add one of your stats. Instead, you answer the four provided questions. Two of them provide a +1 if you answer “yes,” and two of them impose a -1 if you answer “no.” Total up the balance of these questions and roll with that total, taking into account all of the answers.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of condi- tions” <span class="p">means that you learn better when you’re stable, in control of yourself, in balance. The </span>“or” <span class="p">in the question means that if you satisfy either question, you get the +1. So, if your balance is in line with your center you get a +1, or if you have no conditions marked you get a +1.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you and your teacher share at least one background” <span class="p">means that you have a slightly easier time learning from a teacher with whom you share something in common. You aren’t penalized for being different, but the similarity can smooth the way forward— so if you answer yes to this question, you get a +1 on the move.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training and learning” <span class="p">means your teacher both understands why you want to train—the real reason, not any lies or half-truths you might have tried to use on them—and approves. In rare circumstances, your teacher might still understand your reasons for training with- out you explaining. You might even have lied to your teacher, only for them to see through your lies! But the vast majority of the time, if you’ve obscured your reasons, your teacher won’t know the real reasons and thus can’t agree with them. When your teacher doesn’t agree with your reasons for learning, they have a harder time teaching you—there’s a fundamental divide between you that makes the training more difficult. So, when the answer to this question is no, you take a -1 on the move.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, and skills?” <a href="part87.htm#bookmark168" class="s22">means that difficult, complicated, or strange techniques are harder to learn. More powerful techniques are generally more complicated to grasp. Similarly, rare techniques may be even more complicated to grasp, and techniques tied to specialized forms of bending that the PC hasn’t learned yet— metalbending techniques, bloodbending techniques, combustion- bending techniques—are the hardest. (For more on specialized bending, see page 216.)</a>
<span class="p"> The GM is the final arbiter of whether</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the technique is easy to grasp or not but should focus on the extent of the PC’s skills and all the techniques they’ve learned so far. In general, if there is any doubt about whether the technique should be within the PC’s grasp, then the answer to this question is “no”, and would impose a -1 on the roll.</p>
