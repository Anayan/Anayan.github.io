<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For most of recorded history, the world has been divided into the Four Nations, each with its own form of bending and unique cultural characteristics. Each nation is unique, but a few con- cepts and organizations span the entire world. This section looks at various topics important to people throughout the nations and the impact they have on the Avatarverse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part13.htm#bookmark23" class="s22">Certain people can manipulate one of four elements. This ability is called bending, and its origins go back to when humans built cities on the backs of the lion-turtles thousands of years ago (page 16).</a> After humans left the lion-turtle cities for good, legend says that they learned bending from animals like the earthbending badger-moles, firebending dragons, airbending sky bison, and in the case of Waterbenders, the spirits of the moon and ocean.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">All benders are born with innate elemental abilities, and must undergo training to master their element. They can only bend a single element, though specialized forms of bending can push that element to its limits. For instance, some Earthbenders can metalbend, some Firebenders are able to generate or redirect lightning, and some Waterbenders can use their bending to heal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">Though often used for fighting, bending is also used for practical purposes such as construction and farming. The type of bending a person is born with depends on the nation they come from and those who have parents from different nations might be born with either of their bending abilities. After the Har- monic Convergence of the Korra Era (page 80),</a> numerous</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">non-benders from across the world suddenly gained the ability to airbend, irrespective of their cultural background.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many benders fear chi-blocking, a special technique that disrupts the flow of chi energy through one’s body and there- by their bending ability. This technique was once so rare that up until the Korra Era, only a select few had mastered the art.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chi-blockers quickly jab at certain pressure points in their oppo- nent’s body, often with their fingers or knuckles. While anyone can learn chi-blocking, non-benders often learn this technique to defend against benders. In addition to disrupting bending, chi-blocking can lock up the target’s muscles, making it tempo- rarily difficult or even impossible to use them.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Technology</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Progress in the Four Nations is all about ingenuity and vision. Throughout each era, inventors create new and innovative tech- nology that pushes society forward. What that technology looks like is dependent where the inventor is located, and may or may not involve the use of benders. A Water Tribe inventor might prioritize innovative gear to help her people survive the harsh tundra, and an inventor from the Si Wong Desert might create</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a new way to traverse the vast sands. Technologists are creative and masters of solving problems that affect their daily lives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The eras don’t directly correspond to any real-world ana- logues, but each has a theme and aesthetic unique to the setting. Below are a few examples of innovative creations, some inspired by the real world, to give you a feel for what is possible in any given era.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Kyoshi Era</p>

<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A portable water pump to put a dampener on a Firebender’s plans.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Hundred Year War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• A steam-powered Fire Nation dirigible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Medicinal curatives to compensate for the lack of Water Tribe healers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Goggles allowing the wearer to see things at great distances and extremely close-up.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Aang Era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Generators to propel newer, larger pieces of machinery.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A gas-powered snowmobile to race between the slopes of the Southern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• An electric lamp to brighten the deepest badger-mole tunnels.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Korra Era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A speedy motorcycle to zip through the roads of Republic City.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• An electrified baton to fend off Triad members.</p>

<a name="bookmark33">The Spirit World</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">From the time the Avatar first came into existence until the Har- monic Convergence during the Korra Era (page 80),</a> humans and spirits lived in separate worlds. Once, spirits and humans could travel bodily between the worlds through the spirit por- tals, but Avatar Wan closed them during his time. Afterwards, crossing between the physical and spirit worlds was still possi- ble, but a rare occurrence. To reach the Spirit World a human had to project their spirit out of their body via meditation or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be stolen against their will by a malevolent spirit. Likewise, if a spirit wanted to travel to the physical world, they could only</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cross over at certain locations, during specific times of the year, such as during a solstice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Just as the physical world has many different types of people and places, the Spirit World is home to many kinds of spirits and landscapes. There are mountains, valleys, groves, and great bodies of water, some which appear inviting while others are bleak and forbidding. One such place is the Fog of Lost Souls, where trapped humans relive their worst memories over and over again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">During the Harmonic Convergence ten thousand years after Wan, Avatar Korra decided to keep the spirit portals at the North and South Poles open so that spirits and humans could</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">find a way to achieve balance side by side. She also inadvertently created a new spirit portal in Republic City. Ever since then, spirits and humans may physically cross back and forth between the worlds easily, and many spirits reside in the human world.</p>

<a name="bookmark34">The Order of the White Lotus</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Order of the White Lotus is a secret society with members from all Four Nations and their subtle, yet masterful influence is felt in all five eras. A group of benders and non-benders alike, the organization is not based in any one location and operates</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">throughout the entire world. The White Lotus originated from a group of scholars dedicated to improving the world and uniting the nations. Through the years the group focused their efforts on guiding the Avatar as a way to foster balance in the world and work for the greater good.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The game Pai Sho holds an important role in the White Lotus organization. Throughout its existence, its members used the game as a method of secret communication. Pai Sho allows members to strategize and pass information to one another out in the open, without anyone else knowing what is being com- municated. Additionally, society members can recognize others through the symbol of a white lotus that resembles the white lotus tile in Pai Sho.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">The White Lotus functioned in secret for the majority of its ex- istence until Iroh, revealing himself as a leader of the order, mobi- lized them in the liberation of Ba Sing Se during the Hundred Year War, at which point they became more open with their actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By the time of Avatar Korra, their existence was public knowledge and agents of the White Lotus were easily identifiable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark68" class="s22">Soon after the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, conflict within the Order led to the birth of a new group that split off from the White Lotus. The Red Lotus was an anarchist move- ment within the White Lotus originally led by a man named Xai Bau. The group later became an enemy of Avatar Korra, attempt- ing to bring an end to the Avatar’s reincarnation cycle altogether. Read more about the order of the Red Lotus on page 80.</a>
</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Discrimination and Challenges</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Like the real world, the Avatarverse is filled with a variety of beliefs and points of view, including views that unfairly discrim- inate or cruelly draw power from targeting “others” within any given society. <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories often grapple with issues of gender, sexuality, and class—and like the real world, there may be racial or ethnic discrimination underlying these issues.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What discrimination looks like in the Avatarverse depends on the era and nation in which you’re playing. Fast-held views often change with time and evolve as people confront new perspectives and learn from each other. What may be true for one era may not be true for another. Below are a few Avatarverse examples of what this may look like in your game:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Water Tribes have accepted relationships outside of the heterosexual cultural norm so long as people kept it private. However, the Northern Water Tribe maintained strict gender roles well into the Aang Era, with women only being permitted to learn waterbending for healing and men only for combat. Likewise, for many eras Water Tribe women could not choose their spouses for themselves. By the Korra Era, the Northern Water Tribe did not adhere so strictly to these gendered traditions.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• There is often a vast disparity between wealthy and poor within the Earth Kingdom spanning all the eras. This strife between the classes has led to multiple uprisings in Ba Sing Se and beyond, and remains a constant issue within the Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Fire Nation was relatively tolerant until Fire Lord Sozin. He was responsible for stoking xenophobic hate within his people and also outlawed same-sex marriage later in his life. Sozin used propaganda campaigns to justify committing genocide against the Air Nomads.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Out of all Four Nations the Air Nomads have consistently been the most progressive. Before the genocide, Nomad philosophies meant children were raised by the community rather than a dual-parent home and communities welcomed people from all walks of life. Air Nomads are generally</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">able to love people of any gender or background without fear of being judged or rejected by their people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Telling a story that is other than your own can be a way for you to empathize with an experience outside yourself and grow as a role- player. For example, acknowledging the differences in the Four Nations of how each treats gender and sexuality is an important link to the real-world struggles people face today. The Avatarverse may be fictitious, but the stories told in it are about very real per- severance and growth. Don’t be afraid to feature the challenges certain characters may face depending on where they are from; this can support the personal stories of your heroes and aid in a fun gaming experience.</p>
