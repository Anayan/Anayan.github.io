<p style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the general guidelines provided in this chapter, you can also use <span class="s20">adventure tools </span>to drive the action forward in your story, tie players to the adventure you’re crafting, or punctuate your story with exciting moments or twists.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As you run an adventure, you may naturally use some of the tools here without even intending to include them. For example, <span class="s20">escalations </span>are a tool used to amp up the action in the story when it starts to lag or your players are unsure what to do. You might already think this way as a GM—if the companions spend 15 minutes arguing in the Fire Lord’s palace, a group of guards might round the corner and attack!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These tools are aimed at helping you tell interesting stories and navigate uncertainty in your game. Tools aren’t required for running your adventure, but can add fun new aspects to game- play. As you craft an adventure, think about how one or two of these tools might be useful!</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use escalations when:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The conflict falters and the pace of the adventure slows.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs are unsure of what they should do.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• You want to throw a twist into the game.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Escalations are GM moves specific for your adventure that reveal new information about the situation and force the PCs into action. Use an escalation if the conflicts start to falter, the pace</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the story slows, or the players are unsure what to do. If players are invested in the main conflict in your adventure, it puts new and interesting information (or characters) in their way. If the players are not invested in the main conflict, it gives them oppor- tunities to become involved or demonstrates how their inaction does or does not affect the setting around them. When you create escalations answer three questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">What’s happening? </span>This is the event that unfolds. Remember as you’re describing the event that players can decide to act on it at any moment. Give your players a chance to jump in and be the heroes!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">What happens if the PCs do nothing? </span>What is the conclusion of events if the PCs decide not to get involved? This can be anything from one party overcoming another, a fire spreading through the city, or something valuable being destroyed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">How does this link to the main conflict? </span>Every good escalation links back to the main conflict of your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adventure. Escalations either reveal new information or emphasize things are happening with a conflict even if the players don’t act, so they must connect back to the core issues facing the PCs. Linking your escalation to the main conflict is an easy way to deliver new information to your players organically, without it feeling artificial.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you find it difficult to think of escalations on the spot, you can prepare a few logical escalations based on the characters and con- flicts you have in your adventure before you start play. For each es- calation, map out the three questions above and tie them to your story. Over the course of running the game you’ll notice that as a GM you’re often creating escalations without expressly intending to—this is great! Because the adventure is driven by player action, it’s natural for you to include twists and turns, and reveal new information as the companions interact with the world.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Escalations</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Earth Kingdom guards and citizens are spurred on by the resistance clashing in the streets. If the companions don’t intervene, the Earth Kingdom guards arrest a number of citizens, including the leader of the resistance movement.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The mayor of a small town orders a curfew: no one is allowed outside after dark except the local guard. Anyone caught by the guards is arrested and thrown in jail.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• A group of Firebender bandits raid a village. If the companions don’t help defend the village, the bandits eventually free their leader who flees into the nearby forest.</p>

<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• There is pressure on your PCs to go somewhere or do something.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The time of day is important to accomplish a goal.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A clock in <span class="s10">Avatar: Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is a visual rep- resentation of time passing and mounting pressure on the PCs. Normally, you have a singular clock for your entire adventure, which represents time ticking down to an important event.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">A clock has roughly four sections, each of which represents a narrative amount of time. For example, the time of day changing or a few hours passing. When a section of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the clock is filled, an event happens, applying pressure to the companions. If the entire clock fills up, a difficult confrontation or di-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sastrous event happens—usually, PCs do not want the clock to be filled! Sketch out what these events could be before you start playing so you’re prepared when the game starts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the start of your adventure, draw a blank multi-part clock on a piece of scrap paper and place it in view. Explain what the clock means to your players—for example, “The clock represents time passing. The more ticks on the clock, the more time passes, and the closer your companions are to getting caught and locked up again!”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Mark a tick of the clock when the characters take a signifi- cant amount of time to do something. The ticking of the clock represents a part of the day passing and the pressure mounting on the PCs. Some examples of when to add a tick to the clock would be when the PCs:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Hide for an extended time</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Take a long, but safe route</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Construct an elaborate distraction or clever plan</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Roll a miss (see below)</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the players roll a miss, remember that you can make as hard or as soft a move as you like…including ticking the clock. Advancing the clock is a fairly hard move, but it can be a great way to keep the story exciting! Give the players an understanding of what’s hap- pening in the fiction while you make your move—“You’ve spent</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hours trolling through the library to find a solution to deal with the spirit. Finally, you find the scroll you need, but when you look up from your books you realize the sun has set! I’m ticking a part of the clock. You have to get to the spirit quickly if this is still going to work!”—instead of just saying, “Okay, I’m ticking the clock now…”</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Clocks</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The authorities of an Earth Kingdom city have captured an import- ant rebel leader; the PCs only have a few ticks of the clock before they reveal the rebellion’s secrets!</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The local town is searching for a lost girl; the PCs only have a few ticks of the clock before she’s lost forever in the Spirit World.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A village finds their medical supplies have been destroyed by bandits; the PCs only have a few ticks of the clock before people in the village have to be rushed to the nearby city for treatment.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A flashback is a moment in which you pause your current story and look to a past event. It could allow an NPC to share a story about the current conflict, establish a meaningful connection with a PC, or provide a backstory for their own villainy! Flashbacks are a useful tool because they help to earn emotional investment from your players without investing a lot of in-game time in order to do so. Flashbacks are also often collaborative; players answer ques- tions or describe actions they’ve taken in the past, which creates interest and excitement about the current situation at hand.</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you want your NPC to share a story through a flash- back<span class="p">, pause the current scene and describe a moment in the past</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that the NPC experienced. Explain what happened, who was there, and how the NPC felt about the event. Try to keep most of the flashback in the voice of the NPC, and take the time to fill in details as if you’re the director of the scene explaining what the audience sees. The aim is to make this moment feel like a flashback in a TV show—a cinematic moment of high emotion in which your players see the drama unfolding before them.</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you want your flashback to help PCs establish a meaning- ful connection to an NPC, location, or item<span class="p">, pause the current scene and describe a moment in the past connected to the paused scene. Explain the characters who were there, the setting, and what the stakes of the scene were at that time. Then ask your players ques- tions, which help define what happened in the past. Such as:</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Why are you here?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Who/what is [person, location, item]to you?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• How did it/they help you? Or you help it/them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What ultimately resolved this conflict or encounter?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once your players have answered enough questions to have stakes in the paused scene, conclude the flashback.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s20">If you want mechanical support for your flashback</span>, you can choose to let PCs impacted by the flashback shift their bal- ance towards one of their principles or give the PC a status effect based on what they’ve just thought about—reflecting the way a hero can be thrown off their game with a strong memory. For ex- ample, if they’re remembering a connection they had to a certain situation, it could bring up old memories that change how they feel in the moment, causing them to shift their balance toward the appropriate principle. Or if they’re hearing a previously untold story from an NPC, a shocking revelation might impose <i>Impaired </i>on all the companions present.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Flashbacks</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The leader of the local guard tells the PCs the story of the last attack from the rebels, one that left several of his men dead.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A wise-woman in the town has appeared in the dreams of the PCs, asking for help; what does she look like and what did she say?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Two PCs remember their mother’s illness, shifting balance accordingly.</p>

</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use special circumstances when:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• It’s fictionally appropriate per the events of the story.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Something large-scale and important is going on.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• You want to empower or weaken a group of people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special circumstances are events that affect a large number of people, creating a situation that requires mechanical complica- tions for the PCs. For example, the solar eclipse in the <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>episode, “<i>Day of the Black Sun, Part 2</i>”, rendered Firebenders powerless. Special circumstances are often tied to a timeline within the game you’re playing—the players know when these circumstances are coming and can plan for it, or the special circumstances happen at a decided moment no matter what the companions might do to stop it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Mechanically, <span class="s20">a special circumstance applies an effect to some or all characters based on the fictional positioning of the circumstance</span>. Some are simple, like the example above of a solar eclipse—no one can firebend—but others require more nuance and planning. Either way, a special circumstance isn’t</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">just something the companions have to push their luck to avoid; it’s an ongoing effect they can’t avoid at all, inflicting a condition they can’t remove, a fictional limit that can’t be overcome, or an advantage that can’t be undermined.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Representing more ambiguous special circumstances can challenge you! For example, Sozin’s Comet passing by the planet every century causes Firebenders to gain “…the strength and power of a hundred suns.” That sounds really powerful, but what does that mean for the game? <span class="s20">In cases when the effect of a spe- cial circumstance is mechanically unclear</span>
<a href="part64.htm#bookmark124" class="s22">, use statuses (page </a>151) as a guide. In the case of Sozin’s Comet, for example,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">each Firebender could be <i>Empowered </i>and <i>Favored </i>for the entire session, making both PCs and NPCs formidable opponents!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes a special circumstance isn’t linked to a natural event, but instead to a character who is too powerful or strange to be mechanically considered an NPC. For example, a spirit in the area that nullifies all bending powers forces the PCs to figure out other ways to get stuff done. Or maybe the companions meet Avatar Korra! She doesn’t have time to talk, but Korra re- cruits the players to confront a rampaging group of spirits with a rousing speech. While she races off to face a giant spirit attacking a building, the players turn to deal with the smaller spirits…and gain the status <i>Inspired</i>.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Special Circumstances</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Riots in the streets after a rebel leader was captured have kept the PCs up for days, unable to sleep. They are <i>Impaired</i>!</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The full moon makes all the Waterbenders in the village more powerful than normal, causing them all to be <i>Empowered</i>.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The bandits accidentally angered a spirit associated with the village, causing the entire area to lose its connection to the Spirit World; no one can clear fatigue until someone fixes the problem.</p>
