<p class="s12" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earning Growth</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Growth <span class="p">is a generalized kind of learning, expanding your char- acter’s mind, your experiences, and your skillset. Growth isn’t about training hard, mastering some complicated new technique or ability; growth is about having your ideas challenged and coming to understand yourself and the world better.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For the most part, PCs earn growth through answering growth questions at the end of each session. There are three growth questions that the group always discusses together but answers individually, and then every character has a growth question from their own playbook that they also answer. These questions help sum up the session and point the players toward actions in-line with their playbooks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes, PCs might earn growth through other means, often playbook moves or by <span class="s8">resisting shifting their balance </span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark118" class="s22">(see page 140),</a> but those means always call out the circumstances in which the character earns growth. While the growth ques- tions at the end of each session point toward the lessons your companions have learned, growth you earn during a session usually points toward important experiences you’ve had, like standing up for yourself in the face of pressure!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you “mark growth” or “earn growth,” you mark the next box on your growth track of four growth boxes. Once all four are marked, you earn a growth advancement, improving your stats, learning new moves, unlocking your Moment of Balance, or shifting your balance.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Growth Move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the end of each session, your whole group determines how much growth you’ve each earned through the baseline growth move, answering questions and marking one growth for each yes answered:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">At the end of each session, each player answers the following questions:</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Did you learn something challenging, exciting, or complicated about the world?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Did you stop a dangerous threat or solve a community problem?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Did you guide a character towards balance or end the session at your center?</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Each player also answers their playbook’s unique personal growth question. For each “yes,” mark growth. When you have marked four growth, you take a growth advancement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What Ends a Session?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next few sections cover these questions—and the growth advancements—in greater detail, but one oft overlooked element of the growth move is how often your group makes the move!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most groups treat the “end of session” as the end of a full session of your campaign, but there’s nothing wrong with running shorter sessions (two hours) or answering the growth questions midway through a session if you’ve reached an important stopping point, like the end of an adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The more often your group evaluates growth, the more growth you’re going to earn. Even if you don’t answer yes to every ques- tion every time, you’ll still find your character advancing much faster when you check for growth more regularly. Some groups prefer a more slow and steady pace—only checking for growth at the end of a long session—but a faster pace won’t break anything!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, the growth move should be a reminder that your story is your own, built by your group and featuring your charac- ters. If you feel like you haven’t had a chance to stop a dangerous threat, you can tell your GM you’d like to see more dangerous threats appear on screen. And if you’d like your characters to ad- vance more quickly, you can check for growth more often.</p>

<a name="bookmark162">Growth Questions</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When answering the questions, the player answers on behalf of their character, but at an out-of-character level, looking at the story as a whole. The answers here can reflect the way their PC feels, but can also contrast with their feelings—a character</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">might refuse to acknowledge that they learned how they needed their friends during a fight, but the player can usually still recog- nize that their PC learned that lesson.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately every answer is a conversation, and if the GM and the player or even other players disagree about the answer, then they should keep talking! Growth questions are about the characters, what they did, what they learned, what they felt, but also about getting all the players on the same page regarding the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fiction, what happened, and at least one view of the events of the session. They’re a good chance to collectively review the session and talk about how the players feel, and to come to a shared understanding to move forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s important that the GM and the players agree on the answers to these questions. If anybody honestly disagrees with an answer, then the conversation continues until those players can reach a shared understanding. The GM can make the final call if absolutely necessary, but the GM should give the benefit of the doubt to what the player says. If a player feels that they guided someone toward balance, for example, then the GM should make an attempt to look at the situation through the player’s perspective.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are the base questions in greater detail:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: left;">Did you learn something challenging, exciting, or complicated about the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This question is all about learning interesting things! As long as a PC learned something challenging, or something exciting, <i>or </i>something complicated—not necessarily all three—their an- swer to this question is a yes. Unsurprisingly, you will probably answer yes to this question nearly every session; the whole point of the game is to have fun and interesting adventures!</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Challenging, exciting, or complicated” <span class="p">is a broad set of ideas designed to aim players at thinking about whether or not their characters learned something that expands their view of the world. If a PC “learned” something completely in-line with their expecta- tions or beliefs…they didn’t really learn anything, did they? Push past the ordinary experiences of day-to-day adventuring if you want to earn a growth from this question.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“About the world” <span class="p">also means that the scope of what the character learned can be pretty varied. Learning that a loved one betrayed them is a kind of “learning about the world,” as much as learning that not all Fire Nation citizens are evil is a kind of “learning about the world.” You can also learn more about your own place in the world; discovering that your character wasn’t willing to join a rebellion against an unjust ruler because they feared what the uprising would cost ordinary people is a good hint that you learned something new about your character and their values and goals.</span>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: left;">Did you stop a dangerous threat or solve a community problem?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This question is all about solving problems! As long as a PC helped stop a dangerous threat <i>or </i>solved a community prob- lem—not necessarily both—the answer to this question is a yes.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Stop a dangerous threat” <span class="p">means exactly what it says. Thanks to your efforts, some danger was abated. A dangerous threat doesn’t have to be a person; it could be an avalanche, a volcano, a tsunami, etc. And “dangerous threat” only means that it’s dan- gerous to someone; that someone could be the PC, or it could be innocent townsfolk, or it could be the animals of the forest. “Stopping” the threat doesn’t have to be permanent either. The answer is still yes as long as the danger is abated for now.</span>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Solve a community problem” <span class="p">means that you helped some community of people and solved a problem for or with them. This doesn’t always have to deal with a threat! If the community is divided over the issue of whether or not to invite Earthen Fire Industries to open up a nearby factory, then that might not really be a “dangerous threat,” but it’s definitely a “community problem.”</span>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: left;">Did you guide a character towards balance or end the session at your center?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This question is all about balance! As long as the PC guided another character toward balance <i>or </i>ended the session with their balance at their own center—not necessarily both—the answer to this question is a yes.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Guide a character towards balance” <span class="p">requires conversation and shared understanding, because it partially depends upon the char- acter you guided. If they felt your guidance actually misled them, pushed them away from balance, then the answer might be no.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, even if they ignored your guidance, the answer might still be yes. “Balance” here can mean many things, ranging from trying to help a fellow PC push their balance to their own center, to trying to help an NPC overcome negative emotions that are hurting them and to rebalance themselves, to steering someone away from a path of danger and conflict and toward balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">You <i>“end the session at your center” </i>when, at the end of the ses- sion, your balance and your center share the same point on the track. As long as that’s true, the answer to this question is yes!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Playbook Growth Questions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every player character then has their own specific question keyed to the nature of growth for that playbook. Answer these questions in the same way as the above, breaking them down and thinking about their terms, making sure that the table un- derstands the answer collectively. Often, reviewing the playbook growth questions together is a good way to quickly understand the tensions and arc of each character, as well as where they are on their current journey.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Not all playbook growth questions work the same! Some are very focused, while others are broad and open to interpretation. Don’t worry if you find yourself hitting your playbook’s growth question less often than other players, but try to keep your play- book growth question in mind every session!</p>
