<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part17.htm#bookmark30" class="s25">Iroh is a decorated war general and was first in-line to inherit the Fire Nation throne before his brother Ozai. As a young man, Iroh proved himself worthy to the dragons Ran and Shaw (page 25)</a> who taught him to Firebend without hatred or aggression. In order to protect them, he told everyone he killed the last dragon earning him the ti- tle, ‘The Dragon of the West’. Iroh was also clever enough to watch Waterbenders’ techniques and adapt them to redirect lightning through his body, proving he not only has a keen mind, but ample wisdom.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part29.htm#bookmark54" class="s25">Iroh lost his son Lu Ten during the 600-day Siege of Ba Sing Se (page </a>58). This irrevocably changed him and when his father died shortly after, Iroh left the throne to Ozai. Iroh travelled the world for a time, becoming a member of the White Lotus on his journey, before even- tually returning to the Fire Nation capital and becoming the guide of his nephew Zuko. Iroh is currently travelling the world with Zuko, who has been tasked by his father Ozai to find the Avatar. Iroh is dedicated to Zuko and little could pull him away from helping him. Zuko is ag-</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">gressive and abrasive to anyone who gets in his way. That said, if Iroh’s attention could be diverted for a short time, the only things the old man asks for to share his wisdom are a warm cup of tea and a good conversation.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bitter Rivalry</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many soldiers and officers in the Fire Nation military see the war as an excellent chance to prove themselves and advance in the ranks. This often means competing with peers for a posi- tion or assignment, and this competition can get dirty. Officers may frame others for their mistakes, and soldiers might engage in contests that measure who can do the most damage to an Earth Kingdom village they’re raiding. Lifelong friends turn against each other when a tempting enough prize is on the table, especially if that prize means escaping the more grueling parts of war. One person might even start a rivalry with somebody who doesn’t want anything to do with it, but it’s hard not to partici- pate if your reputation and well-being are on the line.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do Not Question the Fire Lord</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Survival and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Ozai is the supreme leader of the Fire Nation, and that means that his word is the law. Advisors who push back against his decrees end up exiled or assassinated, and military officials reluctant to follow through on his orders are replaced in the blink of an eye. Anyone under the Fire Lord’s employ who wants to rebel must be exceedingly smart, and at least a little bit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">paranoid, to not get caught. The Fire Lord’s spies are everywhere and no one can be truly trusted.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This influence extends to all Fire Nation strongholds; no one is safe from scrutiny. Those who do transgress face pun- ishments based on the severity of their actions. A person who merely questions the Fire Lord’s decisions may get off with a stern warning, but should that person openly question the Fire Lord again, a prison cell may be waiting for them. Those who dare to act against his interests or openly defy his wishes face even steeper consequences.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Silent Rebellion</p>
<p class="s37" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Hope in Rebellion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outside the Fire Islands, Fire Nation officers exert their control over the colonies. While a few officers may act as benevolent rulers, many are power-hungry warlords exerting an iron fist over their population. While these overlords take orders from commanding officers, and in turn the Fire Lord, many are left to their own devices to rule as they see fit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">However, this disconnect from the rule of the Fire Nation also means more room for people to rebel against unjust rule. Secrecy and subterfuge are necessary elements when it comes to fighting the Fire Nation. Those lucky enough to find like-minded individuals must figure out how to meet and communicate with- out getting caught, and should they get caught, they will need a plan of escape.</p>
