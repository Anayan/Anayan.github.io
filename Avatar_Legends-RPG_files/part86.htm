<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Using Techniques Outside of Combat</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Techniques are always combat-oriented in their ef- fects, but if you’ve mastered a technique, then you can always perform it fairly easily. If you want to do that thing outside of combat, you can! It might be a move like <b>rely on your skills and training </b>if there are other uncertainties at play, but when you’ve mastered a technique, the uncertainty is no longer “Am I skilled enough to actually do this?”</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Techniques represent a set of highly-ingrained skills and proficiencies suited for rapid, instantaneous action in the middle of a fight, as well—so some techniques represent abilities you could use regu- larly outside of combat, but are pretty tough to use easily in combat.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">For example, the earthbending technique of Tun- neling refers to quickly diving into the earth and popping back out with speed and accuracy. If you don’t have the technique, you can’t do it as well in combat…but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it at all outside of combat! Most likely, if you lacked the</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">technique, you’d be <b>relying on your skills and train- ing </b>or <b>pushing your luck </b>to do it outside of combat. And if you had the technique mastered, there might be times when you tunnel outside of combat with no uncertainty at all—you can definitely tunnel pretty well, so without other factors at play creat- ing uncertainty, you just do it!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, all advanced techniques—except universal tech- niques—are tied to a particular training like Airbending or Weapons, and can only be learned by a character who possesses that training. Characters who have two trainings, such as one who took the Successor’s <span class="s8">Worldly Knowledge </span>move, can learn techniques from each training. Learning techniques without the appropriate training requires a specific move or feature like the Prodigy’s <span class="s8">An Open Mind </span>move that allows you to adapt the specific techniques of a different training to your own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">
<a href="part129.htm#bookmark243" class="s22">If you want to learn a specific technique outside your train- ing, it’s possible to work with your GM to develop a technique for your training that works in a similar way. For example, you might convert Water Whip (page 282)</a> to Fire Whip, using the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">technique’s mechanics to represent a quick burst of fire similar to a Waterbender’s tendril of water.</p>
