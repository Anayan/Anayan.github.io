<a href="part55.htm#bookmark112" class="s22">In the chapters that follow this one, you can find the rules that govern the conversation—the basic moves (pages 127),</a>
<a href="part69.htm#bookmark141" class="s22"> the playbooks (page 164),</a> and more. But before you read on to those specifics, it’s helpful for you to understand a few core ele- ments of the game that show up in virtually every session!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Fatigue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every companion has a fatigue track with five boxes on it. When you mark fatigue, it represents getting physically, mentally, and/or emotionally tired, stressed, and worn down. Once you’ve marked all five boxes, you’re on the verge of collapsing or passing out; nearly everything risky you do is difficult and might put you out of action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fatigue is a simple, short-term cost that has a big impact on your character when it overwhelms them; but it doesn’t affect them much in the long-term. You might mark fatigue when you bend the elements in a particularly stressful or difficult way—or when you want to strike out with them in a fight—but you can recover that lost energy by getting some rest or when another companion <span class="s8">guides and comforts </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark113" class="s22">you (page 128).</a>
</p>
<p class="s20" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’ve marked all five fatigue boxes, then any time a game rule gives you the choice between marking fatigue or doing something else, you have to do the something else. <span class="p">If a move says you must mark fatigue to use the move…you can’t use the move. If someone or something else inflicts fatigue on you, involuntarily, then since you have no boxes left to check, you mark the same number of conditions instead.</span>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Clearing Fatigue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, how do you get less fatigued? You can always <span class="s8">guide and com- fort </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark113" class="s22">other PCs (page </a>128)—and they can <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>you too! <span class="s8">Guiding and comforting </span>each other allows you to clear fatigue (and conditions) when your companions are there for each other, offering advice and support in times of need!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Of course, getting some rest helps as well. If you get a chance for some time away from your pressing troubles and exciting adventures, you can clear fatigue off-screen:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Sleeping rough, like a night spent on the cold ground with rocks for a bed, clears 2-fatigue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• A night’s rest in a covered stable or barn clears 3-fatigue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A night’s rest in a comfortable space, like an actual house, with a mat underneath you and a blanket over you, clears 4-fatigue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A week’s rest pretty much anywhere—even in the wilderness—clears 5-fatigue.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You need food and water to get the benefits of rest as well—it’s not the kind of thing you need to keep careful track of, but if you rest in the middle of the desert without any water at all, then you’re not going to recover much fatigue, if any.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The same goes for traveling; unless you’ve arranged for highly comfortable, secure passage, you’re only going to clear one or two fatigue on a long journey. Sure, you might get one or two restful days while stowing away on a freighter that takes you all the way from the Fire Nation capital to the North Pole, but the ordinary stresses of avoiding guards, searching for food, and staying out of sight are going to keep you from recovering the way you would if you booked the same trip on a fancy cruise…</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">
<a name="bookmark83">Conditions</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A condition is an emotional state which leaves you uncom- fortable and vulnerable. Every companion has five conditions they can mark when something particularly stressful happens to them: <span class="s20">Afraid</span>, <span class="s20">Angry</span>, <span class="s20">Guilty</span>, <span class="s20">Insecure</span>, and <span class="s20">Troubled</span>. If you don’t have a condition marked, you might still feel that emotion, but it won’t last long or isn’t intense enough to affect your actions. If you have a condition marked, then you feel the associated emotion at some deep level, and it might affect your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">actions in subtle ways for days or weeks, even if you don’t openly show the emotion to others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">How should a character act when they’re Afraid or Insecure? That’s entirely up to you—an angry Kyoshi and an angry Aang are very, very different people! The one thing pre-defined about the effect of each condition is how it affects specific moves you make, giving you a penalty to the following moves. As long as you’re…</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Afraid</span>, take -2 to <span class="s8">intimidate </span>and <span class="s8">call someone out</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Angry</span>, take -2 to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>and <span class="s8">assess a situation</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Guilty</span>, take -2 to <span class="s8">push your luck </span>and +2 to <span class="s8">deny a callout</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Insecure</span>, take -2 to <span class="s8">trick </span>and <span class="s8">resist shifting your balance</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Troubled</span>, take -2 to <span class="s8">plead </span>and <span class="s8">rely on your skills or training</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Condition penalties are added to your stat along with any other modifiers like a bonus from <span class="s8">assessing a situation </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark112" class="s22">(page </a>127) or a playbook move. For example, an Angry character with <span class="s49">Harmony </span>-1 would <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark113" class="s22">(page </a>128) other characters with a -3 modifier!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Taken Out by Conditions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s20">If you’ve already marked all five conditions and you must mark another, you’re taken out. </span>You become unconscious, injured, distraught, or trapped. Your actions can’t trigger moves or affect the scene anymore. You’re at the mercy of the other characters in the scene and might be disarmed, captured, or oth- erwise limited. Even if a companion tries to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>you, you can’t open up to them at all or clear any conditions. It’s not until after the scene ends that you recover, after you’ve had some time off or your opposition frees you. When you recover, clear all marked fatigue, but keep all your conditions marked.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Clearing Conditions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can remove a marked condition in a few ways. One of the other PCs might try to <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>you; or you might do some- thing risky or unproductive to clear a specific condition. To clear…</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Afraid</span>: run from danger or difficulty.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Angry</span>: break something important or lash out at a friend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Guilty</span>: make a personal sacrifice to absolve your guilt.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Insecure</span>: take foolhardy action without talking to your companions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Troubled</span>: seek guidance from a mentor or powerful figure.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After clearing the condition, you feel better about yourself and the situation, but not right away—you fully clear the condition at the end of the scene, not right as you take the action that clears it. Even when you’ve started to let go of the emotion, it takes you the rest of the scene to clear your head and move past the condition.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Clearing Afraid </span>requires you to avoid or flee from a difficult or dangerous situation—anything from running away from a villain to fleeing the room when someone wants to have a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conversation about your recent actions. The key is avoidance! Instead of confronting something, you run from it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Clearing Angry </span>requires you to vent your anger, either by breaking something important or lashing out at a friend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s not enough to just break a random vase—you have to take your anger out on something important. What’s important is different for every character, but the GM</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should ask if and why an object is important when the Angry character breaks it. If you lash out at a friend, it should be clear how your anger pushes you past your usual limits!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Clearing Guilty </span>requires you to pay some cost on behalf of others, those you feel you’ve wronged or let down. It doesn’t require them to actually absolve you of your guilt—just so long as you pay a price in an attempt to redeem yourself. This might be anything from standing alone against a dangerous foe so your teammates can escape to agreeing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to follow the advice of a mentor when it’s hard to follow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Clearing Insecure </span>requires you to jump into action without thinking things through in a desperate bid to prove yourself, putting yourself in danger before you’ve prepared for what’s to come. You might decide to attack a powerful foe before the rest of your team arrives or agree to a difficult task before you’ve heard all the details. Either way, you have to impulsively act without consulting your team or thinking too hard about the consequences.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Clearing Troubled </span>requires you to regain your confidence by seeking guidance and reassurance from someone competent and capable, either a mentor or a powerful figure. “A mentor” covers any NPC whose advice you’ve received or sought before, and a “powerful figure” covers any NPC you see as powerful, be it social power, bending skill, emotional influence, etc. When you’re Troubled, you need help or clarity to restore your confidence. Until you get guidance from someone whose advice has meaning to you, you are plagued by self-doubt and struggling with indecision.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Beryl, the Icon, marks Guilty after she visits her hometown and finds out that while she’s been gone, her sick grandfather passed away. “Beryl wishes she’d been there with every fiber of her being,” says Beryl’s player, Bei.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Beryl clears Guilty after she lets the forces hunting her take her captive, in exchange for leaving her hometown alone, safe and sound. It’s a sacrifice to honor her grandfather and her home—“It’s the least she can do,” says Bei.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remember that even if you take the action, you only clear the condition at the end of the scene. You can clear multiple</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conditions in one scene, but you continue to be affected by the penalty for the entirety of the scene.</p>

<a name="bookmark84">Balance</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every companion has a balance track that consists of two <span class="s20">principles</span>, core beliefs or ideals your character wrestles with throughout their adventures. These principles are opposed, but not directly—they represent different ways of thinking about the world and your character’s problems and rarely boil down to simple opposites. For example, a character whose first principle is <span class="s20">Self-Reliance </span>likely won’t have a contending principle that makes them rely on others; instead, they might have something like <span class="s20">Trust</span>, representing the degree to which they are willing to believe that other people can take care of themselves.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Principles, Balance, and Center</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="#bookmark118" class="s52">principle</a>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s53" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each balance principle reflects a specific worldview, mani- festing as part philosophy and part feeling. When they appear on your playbook, that means they’re both important to your character and in tension with their other important principle, establishing your character’s inner conflict. During the story, your character’s thoughts and experiences push and pull them towards one idea or the other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You track how you feel about your principles on the balance track—both your <span class="s20">current balance </span>and your <span class="s20">center</span>, the point to which you return to when you have time or rest. Your balance may <span class="s20">shift </span>as a result of moves, or as a result of an NPC con- sciously or unconsciously shifting your balance towards a principle by how they speak and behave toward you, but your character’s balance returns to their center over time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It’s up to you to decide how much your current balance affects the way you play your character. A companion whose center is near the middle of the track might be actively pursuing one of the ideals, determined to shift that direction whenever possible; a companion near the edge of the track might be pushing back the other direction, hoping to avoid slipping over the edge of the track and losing their balance. There’s no right answer!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Like conditions, your balance is a tool you can use to guide your character that has mechanical effects, but your balance doesn’t limit your actions unless someone <span class="s8">calls you out </span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark116" class="s22">(page 138)</a> to act in accordance with one of your principles or you <span class="s8">lose your balance </span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark119" class="s22">(page </a>141). In those cases, you work with</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the GM to determine how your character acts when their inter- nal struggle boils over into passionate action!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Shifting Your Balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark112" class="s22">When told to shift your balance toward one principle or the other, you move your balance (however you track it, be it with a stone or a penciled-in circle) toward the end of that track where that principle is written. The moves (page 127)</a> of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>often tell you when to shift your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">balance, but sometimes the GM also shifts your balance because of the decisions you’ve made in the story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When told to shift your balance towards your center, you shift your balance towards wherever your center is currently; when you’re told to shift your balance away from center, you shift your balance away from your center and toward one of your principles. If you are at your center and told to shift your balance away from center, you pick which way it shifts. No matter which direction you shift, you lose your balance if you shift off the end of one side of your track.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quartz, the Guardian, has a balance track split between Trust and Self-Reliance. Quartz’s center is currently at +1 Trust/-1 Self-Reliance, and his Balance is at +2 Trust/-2 Self-Reliance. When talking to another major NPC—a smarmy villain asking for Quartz’s trust—he’s told to shift his balance toward Trust. That would put it at +3 Trust/-3 Self-Reliance, and put Quartz right on the edge of losing his balance!</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Later, with his Balance and center in the same place, Quartz is told to shift his balance toward center. He has to shift his Balance back to +2 Trust/-2 Self-Reliance from +3 Trust/-3</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Self-Reliance—that’s the only direction that counts as “toward center.” Of course, if Quartz was told to shift away from center, he would lose his balance!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Losing Your Balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a shift takes you over the edge, past the end of the track, you <span class="s8">lose your balance </span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark119" class="s22">(page 141).</a> Characters who lose their balance—in- cluding NPCs—lose control of their powers, act out in accordance with their principles, or even give give in to their opposition! They regain control after they have some time to recover, but they must <span class="s20">shift their center </span>
<a href="part88.htm#bookmark169" class="s22">as a result of the experience (page 218).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can never choose to shift your balance off the edge of the track and lose your balance, but several moves—including <span class="s8">resisting shifting your balance </span>
<a href="part58.htm#bookmark118" class="s22">(page </a>140)—allow the GM or other players to shift your balance up to and over the edge of the track.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quartz decides he’s had enough of the smarmy villain and de- cides to resist shifting his balance when the villain pushes Quartz to help him commit a crime. Unfortunately, Quartz misses on the roll; the GM has to shift Quartz’s balance twice! Since Quartz is already at +2 Trust / -2 Self-Reliance, shifting twice towards Trust pushes Quartz over the edge…and Quartz loses his balance! The GM directs Quartz to look at the move—<b>lose your balance</b>—to see what happens next…</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Returning to Center</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whenever time passes—or you have a chance to rest and reflect— reset your balance to your center. A single night usually isn’t enough for your character to regain their composure and bring their balance back to center, but it’s possible that a particularly calming location or practicing meditation might help you find yourself again…</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bending</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, most of the heroes are benders capable of amazing feats. The ones who aren’t benders have incredible mastery of weapons or technolo- gies that rivals bending itself!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But regardless of their bending prowess—or other fantastic abilities—the stories of <i>Avatar Legends </i>aren’t really about the companions’ bending. Instead, the characters use their bending to go on adventures in service of their broader story—finding their role in the world, exploring the drive inside their heart that moves them, caring for the people in their lives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Bending in <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>works the same way—you use it constantly…but it’s not your story. All of the trainings, including bending, are tools your character uses to get stuff done, whether fighting to protect the innocent from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">immediate harm or convincing political leaders to take the prob- lems of ordinary people seriously.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What does that look like in the game? Trainings don’t have a lot of limits, so it’s up to you and your group to say when and how your training is useful. Sometimes, it’s obvious—“I want to water- bend that boat back to us so we can save the people on it!”—but sometimes it’s a bit more subtle—“I want to earthbend out little handholds all up the side of this building so we can climb it!”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Either way, the mechanics of <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>both support and challenge you as you use your powers. As you push yourself to accomplish great things with your training, you’ll find costs and complications that make those accomplishments meaningful; when doing easy things—like lighting a small fire with your firebending—you won’t need to invoke the mechanics at all, and you and the GM will simply say what happens.</p>

<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Haki, the Successor, is trying to get to the top floor of a city of- fice building in one of the Fire Nation colonies, hoping to rescue his friend who was captured by the local authorities.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“No one’s spotted me yet, right? I’ll just use my firebending to leap up to the second floor and break in through a window,” says Hector, Haki’s player.</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 5pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Sure,” says the GM. “I don’t think that’s uncertain or danger- ous, so it’s not even a roll. But once you’re up there, you’ll have to find a way past the guards you saw patrolling when you and the other companions cased the place yesterday.”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Ugh. Could I maybe just jump all the way to the roof using my firebending? It’s only like eight stories, right?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Yes! That would be awesome,” says the GM. “Maybe doing like a wall jump between the office and the building next to it?”</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Hector nods. “Do I need to roll for that?</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah,” says the GM. “That’s a lot harder than jumping up one story, so you’ll have to <b>rely on your skills and training </b>to make it all the way up without any costs or consequences…”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just remember…your training is always real, always part of the fictional position of your character within the story. You can’t water- bend a boat to you if you can’t waterbend; if you’re a Firebender or Earthbender you have to swim to that boat instead. And there are specialized bending techniques using skills like lightning redirection or metalbending that must be learned from others on your journey.</p>
