</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Throughout <span class="s10">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, but especially in combat exchanges, characters might find themselves suffering ill effects or benefitting from positive effects as a result of their environment. They might be lit on fire or caught under a fallen beam. They might be trapped in the earth or be slipping and sliding around on a surface covered in ice. They might be well- equipped and supported for an upcoming challenge or might draw extra strength from the full moon in the sky.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">All of these effects are covered by <span class="s20">statuses</span>, specific states that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">apply mechanical effects to reflect the way the character’s envi- ronment affects them. Many combat techniques assign or remove statuses, but other moves might inflict or bestow statuses as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Statuses are always based on something true in the fiction. No character is ever just <i>Trapped </i>without any further explana- tion—they’re caught by something, be it ice or earth or a fallen building. No character is ever just <i>Empowered </i>without any fur- ther explanation—something empowers them, be it the potency of the place they stand upon in the Spirit World, or the pure intensity of the fire around them enhancing their firebending.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That means that a status can be removed from a character if the fiction changes. If someone’s on fire, but they dive into a lake—they’re not on fire anymore! And they probably aren’t <i>Doomed </i>anymore, as a result. Players and the GM always work together to get on the same page about the cause of a status and its meaning in the fiction. That way, everybody understands how to remove the status, and why a given character might have a hard time with that. An Airbender might not be able to easily clear the ice surrounding them, but a Firebender would have an easy time extinguishing a flaming sleeve!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">NPCs can suffer or benefit from statuses just like PCs and can escape from or lose statuses just as PCs can—as long as the fiction changes, meaning they or others take appropriate action.</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Doomed <span class="p">is the status for when you’re drowning, or when you’re on fire, or when the stone around you isn’t simply immobilizing you—it’s crushing you. It represents a constant, ongoing pres- sure upon you, causing you to mark fatigue at a steady rate until you are free. The GM decides exactly how often you mark fa- tigue during play, unless you’re in exchanges—then, you should mark 1-fatigue at the beginning of each exchange. Remember that if you can’t mark more fatigue, you mark conditions instead.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Much of the time, you can’t be <i>Doomed </i>unless you’re first <i>Im- paired</i>, or <i>Impaired </i>and <i>Trapped</i>. You won’t be drowning unless something holds you in the water; you won’t be slowly crushed by rock without first being trapped in rock. But sometimes it’s appropriate—your entire outfit, head to toe, can be set on fire by an angry firebending master without warning!</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Empowered <span class="p">is the status for when a Waterbender fights under a full moon, or a Firebender draws on the strength of Sozin’s Comet, or a swordswoman has been filled with the invigorating power of a friendly spirit—those moments when you are made far stronger than normal, almost always by something external to yourself.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You aren’t <i>Empowered </i>just because you have the high ground (which is closer to <i>Favored</i>) or because you set up some valuable defenses (which is closer to <i>Prepared</i>); you’re <i>Empowered </i>when you are strengthened far beyond your usual abilities. You usually can’t re- ally pursue this status with a technique during combat—it isn’t the kind of status that a quick tweak to your environment can provide.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM adjudicates <i>Empowered </i>more than any other status, but they’re encouraged, as always, to be a fan of the PCs. If there’s an interesting, believable reason why someone is <i>Empow- ered </i>in this moment—for example, a Firebender standing in the middle of a raging forest fire—then the GM honors that reason by bestowing <i>Empowered </i>upon the character. Similarly, once that believable reason goes away—the forest fire is put out, or the Firebender moves away—then the status also goes away.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Empowered <span class="p">clears 1-fatigue at the end of each exchange, meaning after all approaches and techniques have been resolved. If you’re not in exchanges, then you clear 1-fatigue every few seconds, like an inversion of </span>Doomed<span class="p">.</span>

</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You’re buoyed by circumstance—choose an additional basic or mastered technique in the next exchange, even on a miss.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Favored <span class="p">is the status for when a Firebender jet-steps to the top of the building for a clear vantage on the Earthbenders below, or when an Airbender has accelerated themselves with a gale force wind at their back, or when the Technologist flips on the</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hyper-charge setting on their electric gauntlet. It represents those moments when you have a temporary, situational advantage, whether due to your position in the environment, a quick trick you’ve pulled, or some other fleeting edge. <i>Favored </i>is different from <i>Prepared </i>because <i>Prepared </i>represents real set-up or resourc- es, now being deployed, while <i>Favored </i>doesn’t require any of that set-up, planning, or preparation. In the middle of a fight, if a Wa- terbender smashes a dam and fills the area with water, they might become <i>Favored</i>—it’s not enough of a shift to make them <i>Empow- ered</i>, and too haphazard and immediate to make them <i>Prepared</i>.</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Favored <span class="p">allows you to choose an additional basic or mastered technique in the next exchange, but you cannot use </span>Favored <span class="p">to use the same technique twice. You must also choose a technique from the appropriate approach.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Usually, <i>Favored </i>only affects the single exchange after you earn the status. If there is no immediate exchange after you earn the status, but a new exchange picks up within a relatively close</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">amount of time, then the status affects that new exchange. If there is no exchange at all after you earn the status, it dissipates with no effect—but often, an enemy who realizes their foe is <i>Favored </i>may surrender instead of facing the full force of their foe’s strength.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">You can also lose <i>Favored </i>if something happens in the fiction that takes away your temporary advantage before you get to use it—for example, an Earthbender <span class="s8">advances and attacks </span>and uses Smash against the building you’re standing atop before you can <span class="s8">evade and observe </span>from a higher vantage point.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part130.htm#bookmark244" class="s22">A small set of techniques, such as Lava Star (page </a>283) allow you to extend the duration of <i>Favored </i>for multiple ex- changes, but usually require great skill and concentration!</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impaired <span class="p">is the status for when you’re standing on slippery ice or coughing on the smoke filling the air or sinking slowly into mud. It represents you being thrown off, your footing made unsteady, your strength being sapped. You’re not out of the fight yet, not knocked out…but you’re weakened or held back in some way.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">PCs and NPCs both can ignore the effects of being <i>Impaired </i>at the cost of 1-fatigue. For PCs, <i>Impaired </i>forces them to roll at -2 for any physical action—which includes the <span class="s8">stance move </span>in combat exchanges. A PC might be able to get away with <span class="s8">pleading </span>or <span class="s8">guiding and comforting</span>, without taking a -2 from <i>Impaired</i>, but sometimes it’s still hard to <span class="s8">plead </span>through a cloud of smoke! Marking fatigue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part66.htm#bookmark125" class="s22">to ignore the -2 represents expending extra energy to temporarily overcome the impairment…but it’s still present, and still affects you the next time you try a physical action—you mark fatigue to push your way through the smoke, coughing and wheezing, but still functional. If you wanted to airbend the smoke cloud away, though, you might be better off using Ready (page 154).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, <i>Impaired </i>is usually the first and easiest negative status to inflict on anyone. In turn, it’s usually the easiest status effect to remove. Get off the ice sheet and you’re no longer <i>Im- paired</i>; clear the smoke with a gust of wind and you’re no longer <i>Impaired</i>; dry out the mud and you’re no longer <i>Impaired</i>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For an NPC, the GM makes moves as appropriate to represent how they are <i>Impaired</i>, perhaps creating opportunities in the fiction for a PC to act without an NPC interfering. In combat, an NPC may use one fewer technique (to a minimum of 0) as long as they are <i>Impaired</i>, unless they mark 1-fatigue to push past the impairment.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inspired <span class="p">is the status for when a dear friend has given you the confidence to keep fighting onward, or when you’re invigorated after seeing an ally fighting against impossible odds but some- how winning, or when you see the people you’re fighting for and your resolve becomes steely. </span>Inspired <span class="p">covers those moments when your character is bolstered emotionally, almost like a pos- itive condition—they’re made more determined or bolder, not physically </span>Empowered <span class="p">or situationally </span>Favored<span class="p">.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can choose when you want to clear <i>Inspired </i>to shift your balance toward a principle of your choice. You can clear it the moment you take <i>Inspired</i>, or you can hold onto it and use the status later. <i>Inspired </i>dissipates either when enough time has passed that the extra excitement and energy similarly dissipates, or something happens that robs you of your internal inspira- tion—be it the harsh words of a mentor (or even a foe), or the sight of an ally being defeated.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you do clear <i>Prepared</i>, you have to make sure that it fits the fiction—you can’t clear <i>Prepared </i>for your full-body-slingshot to avoid a condition inflicted by cruel words from your father! You can’t take +1 from being <i>Prepared </i>with your throwing knives to then <span class="s8">guide and comfort </span>a friend! <i>Prepared </i>can still easily apply in situations other than combat exchanges, just so long as the fiction of your preparations makes sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If something else eliminates your preparations—an enemy swordsman cuts the slingshot, a guard takes away your throwing knives—then you lose <i>Prepared</i>.</p>

</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Stunned <span class="p">leaves a character functionally helpless. The status never lasts for very long—no more than a minute or two at most—but that’s always long enough for a foe to take advantage. A </span>Stunned <span class="p">character isn’t able to respond—even in the middle of a fierce combat—which means there’s no uncertainty when an enemy acts against them; the GM just says what happens.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Usually, <i>Stunned </i>is only inflicted by specific techniques and abilities. But <i>Stunned </i>can make sense if someone gets <i>Impaired </i>a second time—perhaps by a strong strike from a blunt weapon or a blast of airbending—depending upon the actual fictional cause. <i>Stunned </i>can occur without warning or any other status if it makes sense in the fiction—for example, it might be the best way to establish the severity of a sudden blow from a hidden enemy.</p>
