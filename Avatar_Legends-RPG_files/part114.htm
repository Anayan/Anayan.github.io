<p class="s12" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Creating Adventures</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you prepare an adventure for your players, gather all of the necessary components—a conflict, a cast of characters, locations—and prep as much as you feel is necessary. You can always follow the guidance and tools in <span class="s20">Chapter 8: Running the Game </span>and <span class="s20">Chapter 9: Seasons &amp; Campaigns </span>to offer your players challenges and conflicts keyed to whatever goes on in your game at any given moment, but it can be useful to have some material ready in advance. That said, there’s no one right way to create an adventure; don’t feel like you need to hit every note of your adventure prep every time you play.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Center Your Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you craft any conflicts or NPCs for your adventure, figure out where you’re starting your game, including the era. If this</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is a one-shot, you could start any time in any era; just pick a location based on what you think is exciting, or focus on what your players are interested in. If your adventure is part of an on- going campaign, pick a location that makes sense for the fiction. Maybe your players said they were traveling to another town in search of a foe—set your adventure in that town as they seek their quarry. Or if the scope of your game is Ba Sing Se and your players indicated at the end of last session they wanted to inter- rogate a minister in the Upper Ring, set your adventure nearby.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">No matter what location you choose, it should be a place that embroils the companions in conflict right away. There’s no point wasting time in your adventure traveling from place to place if nothing happens. Think of the starting point of your adventure like the opening of an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. The heroes arrive in a town…and disaster strikes, or there is someone following them, or they notice something strange in the distance!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What is this place like?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you know where the adventure starts, you can ask yourself what the location looks, smells, and feels like. You can outline where the players could go, and what places in the adventure might be important to various NPC groups. You can never cover every single base, nor should you try—PCs nearly always go somewhere you hadn’t expected. That said, it’s always good to have a few locations sketched out in your mind so you don’t have to come up with everything on the spot, and so you can build on something that exists when inventing on the fly. Remember that you can always ask your players leading questions about the lo- cation to help fill in details based on the characters’ backgrounds and experiences, taking some of the pressure off you! Some general locations to think of are:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• An interesting spot to start the adventure and frame the central conflict of the adventure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Places the various factions can be found—a headquarters or popular gathering spot</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• A few Avatarverse quirks about the location to make the world feel real, like monuments to the past or colorful local traditions</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You don’t need to add any mechanics or rules for the backdrops you envision. Instead, focus on how those spaces might help you frame the conflicts of the adventure and convey the themes of the era. If you want to make Republic City look busy and bustling, then describe an open air market; if you want the city</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to seem gritty and filled with criminal elements, an underground bending ring might be a better fit!</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Central Location</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You’re playing in the Korra Era; at the end of last session, King Wu (may his reign end in democracy) tasked the companions with bring- ing in one of Kuvira’s former generals hiding out in a remote Earth Kingdom village. This general helped Kuvira run numerous worker camps and so far has evaded trial in Republic City for his crimes. You decided to start your adventure in the village where the general is hiding, close to the site of one of Kuvira’s forced labor camps. The village initially refused to bend to Kuvira’s will, but she forced them to surrender and slowly isolated and starved the inhabitants, leaving them broken and vulnerable when the general returned…or at least, so he imagined.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Identify a Central Conflict</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve decided where to set your adventure, craft the <span class="s20">central conflict</span>—the main source of drama and opposition the players will encounter during the episode. Each central conflict needs to act as an anchor for the adventure, a complex encoun- ter that doesn’t have a straightforward answer and requires the players to dig into the source of whatever strife they’ve come across. Sometimes a good central conflict stems from a previous adventure, but often you can root your central conflict in the themes of the era or the realities of the location you’ve picked, representing the natural, emergent disagreements that exist across the Four Nations.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Central Conflict</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When the companions arrive at the village to confront the general, the village has already captured him. Some villagers are intent on in- terning him for life without a trial and are not willing to give him over to the PCs; they mistrust “Republic City justice” after seeing what happened with Kuvira herself. Other villagers insist that the gen-</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">eral be turned over to the PCs for a real trial. The conflict simmers throughout the entire community at all times.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The key to coming up with good conflicts quickly is thinking about meaningful disagreement, places in the setting where people have real reasons, beyond mere selfishness and villainy, to oppose each other and pursue their own objectives. If the companions show up and find out the general is a bad guy with lackeys and scary bending powers, then they have an opponent to fight, but not much else, no real decision to make or conflict to explore. It’s much more interesting if they find out that the people of the village have their own ideas about justice—now they have real problems to solve, without obvious answers!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What if the companions do nothing?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve come up with a central conflict, determine what happens <span class="s20">if the companions do nothing</span>. The players are free to make whatever decisions they want once you’ve presented the conflict, and they may even decide to do nothing—or they</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">might even leave the area entirely! Mapping out a logical course of action gives you the ability to realistically portray the conflict around whatever actions the players decide to take. You can then bring those consequences to bear and show the players how their decision to avoid the conflict affected the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Don’t count the players out, though! If they do sit back and let the conflict unfurl, you can act on your prep and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">portray the world moving forward with them. But at any moment the players may decide to engage the conflict and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">change the course of the story! By pushing things forward in an interesting way, you create room—and a pressing need— for them to jump into the action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Think of this part of prep as getting ready to turn up the temperature in your story. If the players get the sense that inaction or avoidance means that the plot is put on pause, they won’t have much reason to think their decisions matter or jump into the fray. But if they know you’ll move the story forward no matter what they do, they’ll be more inclined to take risks and participate.</p>
