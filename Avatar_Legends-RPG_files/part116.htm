<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What do you want to do?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players often have specific goals for their characters or things they want to happen so their character can progress through their story. It’s always a good idea to check-in with your players at the end of an adventure, asking them what they would like to do in the next few episodes. Their answers can inspire the next adventure and give you ideas to add different features from your players’ stories into the adventure you’re crafting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you run an adventure, you might find that interesting twists often present themselves. The introduction of an NPC the players really like—perhaps a kind, young Earthbender from the village—might prompt you to think about how she might be related to the central conflict, allowing you to establish her as the general’s daughter. However, sometimes it is a good idea to sketch out what that twist could be in advance, as a way of set-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">ting up reveals or dramatic turns you can use if things get boring.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But a twist that isn’t rooted in anything—like a random spirit attack or a sudden and meaningless betrayal—won’t land. Any twist you decide to add into the story must be centered around characters, their drives, and what they could realistically do giv- en the situation. The twist also should not contradict anything you’ve already established through the course of the game; you can’t say the general isn’t really the general if you’ve already established no doubt about his identity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Alternatively, you can also <span class="s20">tie a conflict to a player’s person- al story</span>. Thanks to the nature of the game, all adventures are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inherently tied to the companions through the choices the PCs make as they explore the conflict. As the GM you’re always look- ing for golden opportunities to tie your adventure to a PC’s story in a new and exciting way, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One way to spotlight a player character is to tie the conflict di- rectly to a feature of their backstory and characters important to them. This gives the players additional buy-in for the adventure you’ve crafted and gives them a chance to explore different facets of their character.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Character Tie</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Successor finds that estranged members of her family are the ones leading the charge to punish the general here, in the village. They suffered greatly under Kuvira and the Earth Empire, and they aren’t about to accept help from someone like the Successor—family that didn’t even bother helping them during the war!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part117.htm#bookmark220" class="s22">Like anchor NPCs (page 263),</a> character ties work best when they focus on one character and push on that character’s specific story. Try to avoid situations where every adventure has a tie</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for every character; it strains credulity and can make the entire adventure seem contrived and messy.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Outline Main Characters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you have established a setting and central conflict, <span class="s20">outline the main characters </span>who have a stake in the conflict and can push it in interesting ways. Knowing who the key players are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in any adventure is important, because the companions need interesting NPCs to interact with in order to accomplish almost anything. These characters also provide the main opposition for your players in the conflict, so think about their motivations and goals ahead of time. At a minimum, sketch out the name, role, and stats for NPCs who are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Central to the conflict—who is the conflict about and why?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• In a position of power at the adventure location.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Central NPCs</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Jiro, the general. Drive: repent for what I’ve done.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Chang, the mayor. Drive: keep everyone happy so I’m re-elected.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Wei, leader of angry townsfolk. Drive: hurt Jiro like he hurt my sister.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Yilin, leader of forgiving townsfolk. Drive: stop my friends and family from doing something they’ll regret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s also useful to have <span class="s20">a few general NPCs </span>you can throw in who are interesting, but may not have a clear connection to the plot. Players tend to take action in unexpected ways and having a small library of interesting NPCs means you can pull one out and use them when you haven’t prepared for what the players decide to do. Tying them to the location of your story means they automatically have some sort of stake in the action, but you can quickly define what that is while running your game.</p>
<p class="s39" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example General NPCs</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Hongyi, local merchant. Drive: regain my standing after coming back from the labor camps.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Yuxi, impressionable youth. Drive: discover what happened to my brother who left town during Kuvira’s reign.</p>
<p class="s18" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Kun, chief constable. Drive: exploit whoever I can to grab more power.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Make sure you take the time to <span class="s20">stat up each NPC central to the conflict</span>. It saves you a lot of heartache later on when running combat scenes to already know what techniques each charac-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ter has, how long their balance track is, etc. You might decide mid-session that a previously underused character, perhaps one of your general NPCs, needs to be a major NPC, but you already know those central characters are going to matter a lot!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Preparing NPCs is also a good practice for running more inter- esting combats. When you first start running the game, the basic techniques might seem like a lot to grapple with by themselves, but the more experience everyone at the table has, the easier ad- ventures are to run—giving NPCs interesting techniques to throw at your players keeps combat fun for everyone at the table!</p>
