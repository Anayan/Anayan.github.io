<a name="bookmark202">Threats with Unique Abilities</a>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Many of the most famous antagonists in <i>Avatar Legends </i>
<a href="part87.htm#bookmark168" class="s25">are threats with special abilities—everything ranging from Azula’s lightningbending to Amon’s psychic bloodbending to Varrick’s technological marvels. Some of these are spe- cialized forms of bending (page </a>216), but you don’t need</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">to limit yourself to established powers for your antagonists.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">In order to create a unique ability, decide how that ability works in the fiction first. Does the antagonist bend a spe- cial material or affect the world in a strange way? Are their powers obvious or subtle? How might they affect the PCs?</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Once you know what the power does, give them advanced techniques for combat exchanges as needed—like Azula’s lightningbending—or express their powers through other mechanics like status effects—Amon is a bloodbender who is effectively always <i>Empowered</i>. In many cases, you</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">won’t need any sort of special mechanics; Varrick’s amazing abilities are already covered by the existing mechanics of the game, including the fictional positioning inherent in his amazing (and conveniently available) devices and machines.</p>

<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Creating Threats</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part97.htm#bookmark188" class="s22">Of course, characters won’t grow and change without some serious opposition. The rules for creating NPCs (page </a>234) and statting up characters when you prep an adventure are great for giving you the tools you need to make NPCs feel real within</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">your game, but when pondering about the broader campaign, it’s useful to think about the two types of antagonists that show up across a season: episode threats and season threats.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Episode Threats</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most common threats you create as a GM are designed to last for a single adventure, like a Fire Nation general laying siege to the same town the PCs need to enter to deliver an important message. These <span class="s20">episode threats </span>are important characters in a given session—stat them up with everything they need to be meaningful opposition—but they don’t need to be more com- plex than they appear on the surface.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For each episode threat, make sure you have a clear sense of their immediate goals. They may show up in more than one ad- venture, but their sights are always set on what’s right in front of them. As an episode threat, the Fire Nation general is primarily focused on the immediate siege; at some point she can become a season threat (see below), making a play to conquer the entire Southern Water Tribe, but that can come later, when you’re sure the PCs are interested and invested in her as an antagonist.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Episode threats tend to be major NPCs, but they might also occasionally be master NPCs if it suits the fiction—for example, if they’re an especially dangerous expert in their fighting style.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Resolving an episode threat usually means defeating them in a meaningful way within that adventure or session. If the Fire</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nation general is beaten back and her ships destroyed, then that may very well be the end of her role as a threat. Even if you think it makes some sense she sticks around, she should only continue to be a part of the story if there is some strong, pressing reason for her to remain—a reason that goes beyond just what the char- acter wants. If the PCs are very interested in her, or the players found her an awesome character, or she came to serve some</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vital role in the overall story, then it makes sense that she might return and become a season threat. Otherwise, when an episode threat is defeated, that ends their role in the story!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Season Threats</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a threat spans multiple episodes, doggedly pursuing or antago- nizing the PCs even when defeated or thwarted in a single session, then it’s likely a <span class="s20">season threat</span>. These NPCs are more capable and crafty (usually), but they also tend to be figureheads for larger or- ganizations and movements who have the capacity to enact larger changes on the world. They have specific goals, but those goals focus on the bigger picture; if the Fire Nation general was a season threat, she would focus on a larger goal appropriate to your game’s scope—so for your game set in and around the South Pole, she might be focused on conquering the whole continent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Season threats are almost always master NPCs, capable of taking on a whole group of companions by themselves, but they rarely travel alone. They often have minions and soldiers (General Zhao) or equally capable close friends (Zaheer)…or both (Azula). Occasionally an episode threat might graduate to</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span>
<img alt="image" src="../imgs/Image_255.png"/>
</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a season threat, in the same way a minor NPC might become a major NPC, but these threats are rare and special; you usually only have one or two per season, only designing them when you need some true opposition for the PCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you decide on a season threat, establish an <span class="s20">imbalance </span>fundamental to the character, a twisting of their principle that has pushed them into villainy. Zaheer’s Freedom principle, for exam- ple, has been corrupted into Chaos—he believes that indiscrim- inately killing the world’s leaders is the same thing as setting the world free—while Kuvira’s Pride principle has grown into Hubris, a belief that she and she alone can rule the Earth Empire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These imbalances don’t replace the character’s principle, but they offer you a sense of how the season threat acts in the absence of opportunities to achieve their immediate goals, and a way to predict how they act as their center shifts further and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">further to the end of their balance track. Unlike episode threats, season threats have the capacity to change tactics and seize opportunities. For example, Zaheer murdered the Earth Queen when it became apparent she couldn’t deliver Korra, and Kuvira harnessed the destructive power of spirit vines when even Var- rick decided they were too dangerous to use any further.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Resolving a season threat means addressing the character’s fundamental imbalance in a meaningful way, either by forcing them to confront how their imbalance hurts everyone around them…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part110.htm#bookmark203" class="s22">or ensuring that they lack the power to ever accomplish their goals again. Most of the time, season threats can only be resolved through a season finale (page 254);</a> any defeats such a threat suffers before the end of the season are mere setbacks in their pursuits.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How Resolved Are These Threats?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In both cases, resolving threats can sometimes lead players to be a bit confused about how “resolved” the threat really is by the end of the story. Wouldn’t the Fire Nation just send another general out to lay siege to the town? The Avatarverse touches on some serious</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">stuff; is it even possible to resolve a threat born from poverty or war? In general, threats exist to give voice to a particular set of con-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">flicts. Defeating them doesn’t completely resolve the underlying issues—benders and non-benders still have to figure out how to share power in Republic City after Amon is defeated, for ex- ample—but the immediate crisis comes to a close in a way that resolves the issue at hand and allows everyone to move forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In other words, the companions may not be able to punch poverty in the face… but they can stop a bureaucratic foe from throwing people in prison for failing to pay their taxes. And if they find a way to expose that official’s traitorous dealings with the local bandits, then they may give the whole town a chance to deal with the problem differently. It is unfair to the PCs to have the same issue show up again immediately—as if Zaheer escaped from prison at the start of <i>“Book 4: Balance,” </i>or Fire Lord Ozai suddenly got his powers back after Aang took them away—but the conse- quences of the companions’ actions create space for new conflicts and threats that reflect a new set of issues!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">It’s useful to think of this resolution through a lens of hope. PCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">who encounter the same problems over and over again will come to lose their belief that the world can get better. When a season threat is resolved, there should always be a real note of hope in their de- feat—a real sense that this is a chance for things to actually improve.</p>
<p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Pacing Your Season</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How you pace your episodes across a season depends on your group, the story, and how everyone feels on that partic- ular day. Getting better at pacing the game is like practicing and strengthening a muscle, and it requires attention to your specific game, the players, and the situation. What works for you during your early sessions may change as you grow and develop as a group of players, learning the system and expect-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing more from each other. That said, here are a few general tips for pacing plays:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Don’t worry about “filling up” four hours of game time. </span>Many game conventions treat this as the standard length for a roleplaying game session, but you absolutely do not have to stick to that. An action-packed or emotional two hours can be just as, or even more, satisfying than</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">four long hours. Work with your group to find the right length for your sessions, and talk often with each other about how sessions feel when you finish one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Feel free to skip time between episodes. </span>Time is malleable! Days, weeks, or perhaps even months could have passed since the last time we saw the companions on-screen. An episode can represent one night or one week. If nothing interesting will happen for a stretch of time, or if the companions take a little break, simply skip</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">forward. Don’t count every night of sleep and play out every single day unless it’s interesting to everyone to do so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Think about fatigue. </span>Be thoughtful about how the passage of time affects the companions’ fatigue tracks. If you allow them to rest and recuperate often, they will have lots of fatigue to throw at problems. But if you push them to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">their limits with fast action—or no safe breaks—they will eventually have nothing left in the tank. Sometimes the former can be a lot of fun as the companions throw lots</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of resources at obstacles and challenges, but sometimes the tension of limited resources is more interesting!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s20">Storytelling and roleplaying can be exhausting. </span>Take breaks! Apart from helping meet everyone’s biological needs, breaks help your brain rest and come up with better, more awesome ideas. There’s nothing wrong with pausing right before you make an important GM move—like a commercial break!—to take your time to think through the implications of what you’re about to say. Remember that gaming online is especially tiring; many groups default to a break every hour when playing over video calls.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Above all else, remember that your story needs to move at a speed that fits your group and the story you’ve chosen to tell. Don’t panic if a game set in Republic City amid a brewing Triad war has a different pace than a game focused on a pastoral jour- ney across the Earth Kingdom. Each campaign and season has its own pace, and you don’t need to rush!</p>

<a name="bookmark203">Finales</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a number of adventures, you will get the sense that it’s time for this chapter of your story to come to a close. Usually this happens around ten sessions, long enough for the conflicts you established in character creation and your first session to blos- som and grow, but—hopefully!—long before everyone’s gotten tired of the antagonists and issues that have taken center stage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you sense that your story is reaching an inflection point, take stock of the <span class="s20">core questions </span>that have been raised by the conflicts at hand. For example, you might ask “Will the villains of my story get their hands on the powerful artifact?” or “Will the PCs be able to convince the Fire Nation to arrest a dangerous political figure?” Since you’re <i>playing to find out what</i>
</p>
<p class="s19" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happens<span class="p">, these questions should abound! The core questions are those occupying the most time, the ones that you want resolved if you were watching your campaign like a show.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As your story progresses toward the end of a particular chapter, one or two core questions may come into sharper focus and demand more urgency; note which seem the most relevant for the current arc and use them to build a <span class="s20">finale</span>. The goal of a finale isn’t to answer the question <i>for </i>the players, but to instead give them a chance to answer it once and for all by escalating the situation—to focus the story—and offering paths to resolution that make their decisions truly meaningful.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Escalate the Situation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In order to create a situation that truly answers the core ques- tions you’ve selected, <span class="s20">escalate the situation </span>in a finale to bring the conflicts into sharper focus. You want the companions to be unable to ignore the question as they are forced to deal with threats that feel worthy of a finale—invading armies, terrifying</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">plots, giant mechs! Your players should be keenly aware that this adventure is the end of the season, even if the “finale episode” spans two or three sessions of play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Don’t be shy when you escalate for a season finale; your players need to have the core questions thrown into sharp relief so they can rise to occasion. For example, in <i>“Book 1: Air” </i>of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, Amon and the Equalists moved from a fringe, criminal group to an occupying force, revealing substantial military might and coordination as they began to purge bend- ing from the city. The core question of “Will the Equalists seize power in Republic City?” escalated into a crisis that demanded that Team Korra confront Amon directly. Merely waiting for the police to handle the Equalists was no longer an option!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the same time, remind your players that moves like <span class="s8">rely on your skills and training </span>or even <span class="s8">push your luck </span>depend on fictional positioning: it might not be possible for the companions to hold back a tsunami with their waterbending or stop an invading army from overtaking the city. Escalations create situations that demand new ways of approaching problems beyond individual moves; the companions can’t just enter a combat exchange and make <span class="s8">stance moves </span>to fight off a platinum mech the size of a building! Instead they need to look at the problem with new eyes, marshaling allies, new abilities, and clever plans to address the question that the escalation poses for their team.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Offer Paths to Resolution</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As your players confront the escalation of the finale, be thoughtful about providing enough fictional positioning to give them a way to confront the threats. If an invading army has arrived at Republic City, make it clear who leads the army, what they want, and what weaknesses they might have in their forces. Don’t give the players a path they have to follow to find victory—they have to come up with their own plans—but make sure that everything happening is grounded in a shared understanding of the situation at hand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, a villain who wants a powerful artifact might use an ancient ritual to summon titanic rock monsters to capture the PCs…no matter the cost to innocent bystanders. The companions probably can’t fight the creatures directly, but running from the villain isn’t answering the core question either. Make it clear what the stakes are by grounding the creatures in some limits and conditions. Perhaps the creatures only last until sundown or maybe they are bound directly to the villain such that defeating him destroys them; either way, you’ve grounded the story in such a way that the PCs can still make choices—and triumph—in the face of the escalation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">That said, heroes don’t always win. It’s possible that the end</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of your season might result in a tragic setback for the PCs. In <i>“Book 2: Earth” </i>of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, Azula emerged the victor—Ba Sing Se fell, Aang was nearly killed, and Team Avatar had to retreat in order to live to fight another day. You still <i>play to find out what happens</i>, and sometimes what happens is a loss that changes the world forever. Your group has to return for another season to find out how those changes—like the death of a pow- erful monarch—leads to new challenges in the future…</p>
