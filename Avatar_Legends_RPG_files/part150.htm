<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On its face, this adventure seems to be a straightforward escort quest, but there’s plenty that can change the course of events and send things down new paths. In this section you will find additional advice and assistance for handling the mission and the many different courses it might follow. After all, players are always ready and waiting to surprise their GM.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use escalations if the conflicts start to falter, the pace of the story slows, or the players are unsure what to do. They reveal new information about the situation and force the PCs into action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The adventure picks up with the PCs having already accepted Qian Yu’s request for aid—the PCs are now embroiled in the situation, and they are likely to become targets all on their own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are escalations listed with each of the locations of the adventure, giving you ideas for specific events that might occur within those locations to amp up the tension and provide new conflicts. These escalations are a bit more general, designed to be adaptable to multiple different locations in the event that you need additional moves to make to keep the adventure tense and exciting. Here are some examples of escalations you can use:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part148.htm#bookmark358" class="s25">• A cadre of Yu Dao bounty hunters shows up, spurred by Sparrowkeet Air’s wanted posters for Qian Yu, after locals reported seeing someone who looked like her. The bounty hunters will accost the heroes the instant they believe something suspicious is going on or that they recognize either Qian Yu or one of the PCs from a prior conflict. The bounty hunters are careless in their pursuit and end up damaging property and (unintentionally) harming civilians if they aren’t stopped. Use the overarching Yu Dao Bounty Hunters Guild NPC group on page 150</a> to respresent the whole group as it moves into the area and causes damage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">• One of the individual Yu Dao bounty hunters has set</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a trap for the heroes and Qian Yu, likely at a refueling area! The trap plays to that bounty hunter’s strengths and gives them some immediate advantage, perhaps inflicting 2-fatigue on each PC before the fight even begins, or inflicting the <i>Trapped </i>status upon each PC.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A trap planted by Koa and the Snow Rats springs up around the players, especially taking advantage of natural terrain or open areas. The Snow Rats close in and the PCs only have mere moments before they are captured—first they have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">to get out of the snare before they have a chance to fight!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A person in one of the locations recognizes Qian Yu from the wanted posters. They contact Sparrowkeet Air and the mobile HQ heads to their location to pick her up. The</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">heroes see the giant dirigible approaching from a distance; they have some time before it actually arrives, but they have to rush to finish refueling and doing anything else in the location before the HQ dirigible can begin an attack.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 83%;text-align: left;">Delivering the Artifact to Another Party</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The antagonists of this adventure aren’t out-and-out evil, and letting them obtain the artifact has costs, consequences, and dangers, but it isn’t the end of the world. There are some cir- cumstances in which the PCs might decide to give the artifact to those antagonists—especially if, for example, they are able to sway Yuzhen Jr. and make him an ally instead of an antagonist. But they might even be willing to trade the artifact to save Qian Yu in a dire situation, even if they haven’t actually formed any kind of bond with Yuzhen Jr.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the heroes decide to give the artifact to Sparrowkeet Air without having changed anything about the company or its lead- ership, then the best option is to follow the consequences of that decision as they ripple out, based on what makes sense in the fiction. For example, it’s unlikely Avatar Aang or the Air Acolytes would hunt down the PCs in revenge! However, as the artifact changes hands between selfish parties, imagine how its historical knowledge could be twisted. Yuzhen Jr. would easily sell the artifact to someone else for the sake of saving his business, and the buyer could easily misuse the artifact’s potential. In a longer campaign, a delicious and terrible callback would be for the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PCs to later face a foe armed with weapons or attacks developed with the knowledge they sold. In a shorter game, portray the misuse immediately and exaggeratedly—the Air Nomad artifact quickly provides a means for the Sparrowkeet HQ to become a terrifyingly dangerous weapon! Even if Sparrowkeet doesn’t try to use that weapon immediately, its existence should be alarming enough to provoke a response from the PCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the heroes decide to give the artifact to a Yuzhen Jr. convinced of the need to act responsibly with the artifact—as in, convinced not to sell it for the highest price, or to misuse its potential—then they may actually achieve a satisfying, positive end to the adventure! Yuzhen Jr. won’t automatically return it to the Air Acolytes or Aang, but he also won’t abuse the artifact, and if he can come to an arrangement that saves his company but returns the artifact to the appropriate parties, he will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If the heroes decide to give the artifact to Ume, the inquisi- tive and obsessive inventor, then similarly follow out the natural consequences of that decision. If Ume has so far demonstrated no restraint, and the PCs haven’t done anything to try to change her mind or convince her of any particular use for the artifact, then</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">follow that through! In a longer campaign, the heroes might revisit Ume to see some of the world-changing and potentially danger- ous inventions she has made...and to discover that she’s already sold some of them! In a short game, examining the artifact helps Ume instantly learn how to turn her new device into a terrifying airborne war machine! She doesn’t want to use it to attack or cause harm...but now that she’s made it, it becomes a whole new object of pursuit for groups like Sparrowkeet Air.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On the other hand, if the PCs have convinced Ume to show some restraint, or are willing to help guide her and how she uses the artifact, then perhaps she can find a way to do real good with it! She might not have deep respect or reverence for the past, but it isn’t impossible for her to do some real good. Pay attention to how the PCs spend time with and influence her, and reflect that attention in the consequences of Ume’s actions.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 83%;text-align: left;">Defeating the Roster of Bounty Hunters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s absolutely possible that the PCs run roughshod over the boun- ty hunters of the Yu Dao Guild, leaving their foes behind them in shambles. If this happens, don’t panic! In general, any such defeat will leave the bounty hunters with a few bruises to the head and to their pride, but otherwise they’ll be able to soldier on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s more, Yuzhen Sr. has plenty of money to throw at more mercenaries and bounty hunters. Quirky and costumed bounty hunters—increasingly ridiculous if your table enjoys that tone—with uniquely described attacks are an excellent option. Expand on the Badger-Frog Bountymaster, Princess Flutterbat, and the Claw. Provide any new bounty hunters with a technique that reflects their particular way of operating, and default to making them minor NPCs—within this adventure, they exist to get tossed around! If you want to indicate that ever more dangerous bounty hunters are taking up the job as Yuzhen Sr. increases the price on Qian Yu’s head, then consider making them major NPCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Alternately, recurring and distinct bounty hunters who just won’t give up (think: “Sparky Sparky Boom Man”) are classic and fan favorite foes of the Avatarverse. Don’t be afraid to recycle. The three individual bounty hunters in the “Important NPCs” section each make for a good recurring bounty hunter foe, even if defeated earlier. Upon further appearances, you can also give them new techniques, or even upgrade them from minor NPCs to major NPCs to indicate how they are becoming more determined and more dangerous as the adventure wears on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Koa and the Snow Rats represent another angle on the mercenaries dispatched to hunt the PCs. They can be dangerous and capable, and because they are a bit less on the delightfully over-the-top side than the Yu Dao Bounty Hunters Guild, they likely will wind up provoking a more serious response from the PCs as well. You can create new groups like Koa and the Snow Rats, but in general you should create more of the Yu Dao boun- ty hunters before mimicking the Snow Rats. Koa and the Snow Rats actually have motivations beyond pure victory and glory; they should consistently return even if defeated because the PCs can form relationships with them, and can even possibly change their minds or affect their pursuit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Finally, if the PCs are consistently defeating the pursuing op- position and the chase doesn’t seem dangerous or tense enough, be sure to use local informants and the Sparrowkeet Air dirigible HQ itself. Sparrowkeet Air guards and Captain Biho can be dangerous threats unto themselves, not least because with the HQ in the air, their numbers are functionally endless. Even if the PCs defeat one group of guards, another is on its way soon. Local informants can always tip off the Sparrowkeet Air dirigible as to the heroes’ location.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s more, those local informants can even try to hold or apprehend the PCs themselves. Usually, if that happens,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">they’re doing it because they have some desperate need—most likely for money. The local informant is likely no real match for the PCs in a fight, so don’t worry about giving them fatigue or conditions; instead, the PCs are left with the difficult decision of how to deal with someone in dire need of money, trying to turn them in or capture them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Final Fight</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the end of the adventure, the PCs are likely to make one final push to get to the Beifong Metalbending Academy as fast as pos- sible. To give the adventure a satisfying final conflict, this is the time to give the PCs a chance to overcome their primary opposi- tion and evade their pursuers once and for all. That might mean giving some of the bounty hunters one last chance to catch up to the PCs, or it might mean having Sparrowkeet Air HQ crest the horizon and come barreling down on Yu Dao to intercept the PCs before they can reach the Academy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In general, keep in mind that Toph Beifong’s Metalbending Academy is the best safe haven Qian Yu could think of, for good reason. The students learning metalbending are all quite capable on their own, not even counting the first wave of students who are now helping Toph to teach, and of course Toph herself. Toph holds enough political and commercial clout that the Yuzhens would be reluctant to face off against her in a direct conflict in the first place, although the bounty hunters may not be quite</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so careful, and the Snow Rats might be willing to use greater subterfuge and other tactics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The final confrontation can happen at the Metalbending Academy, even after the PCs arrive (see the escalation for the Metalbending Academy location), but most likely, the best place for the final confrontation is actually on the path to the Acad- emy, either in Yu Dao or on the stairs themselves. Play up the “race to the finish” aspect of the conflict—if the PCs and Qian Yu can reach the Academy, they might be safe, or at least get enough help to shift the odds!</p>
