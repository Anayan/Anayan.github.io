</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To start the game, the players have to answer a few questions to establish why President Moon trusts them and would turn to them in a moment of need. <span class="p">Then the adventure picks up with the PCs being tasked by the President with finding Varrick.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you are using this adventure as a one-shot or the beginning of a campaign, then you need no additional inciting incident— President Moon calling the PCs together can effectively be the inciting incident of the group. The PCs likely know each other, having met around the city, but they don’t have to have been particularly close so far.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, all PCs have a relationship with Zhu Li herself to help explain why she would call on them in the first place. After all the PCs have been introduced, the GM asks each question, one at a time, of every player. Every player provides their own unique answer to the first question before the group moves on to the second. The GM should vary the order of players they ask to ensure no one has to answer last every time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• When did you come to the attention of President Zhu Li Moon before?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What did you say or do to earn Zhu Li’s trust?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Why are you willing to do as Zhu Li asks?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The adventure starts with the players waiting for President Moon, who summoned them to meet her at the Presidential Box in the arena. <span class="p">They don’t know why they were so suddenly summoned and brought in through the underground players’ entrance. The GM can ask each player where their PC was and what they were doing when President Moon’s aides found them.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When President Moon arrives, she is accompanied only by her executive secretary, Sho Lin. The PCs can tell something is not quite right; an air of anxiety hangs over the scene. <b>After</b>
</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exchanging a personal welcome to each hero based on their connection with her, she explains what has happened:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Sometime in the morning, before the final match of the Spring Pro-Bending Tournament Qualifier, First Gentleman Varrick took a break to stretch his legs. In truth he left to attend a secret meeting he promised to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">explain to Zhu Li when he returned… but he never did.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• His security team searched the area but found no trace of the First Gentleman. Rather than alarm the citizenry, they took the matter to President Moon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The president has called upon the heroes to find Varrick, quickly and quietly. She explains the “Varrick Rule”— that the First Gentleman has disappeared a bit too often, only to turn up unharmed in ridiculous circumstances</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a few days later, and Chief Beifong no longer takes his disappearances seriously. President Moon has therefore yet to mention the disappearance to Lin Beifong, but she has a bad feeling about this disappearance. President</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moon must return to City Hall to continue her presidential duties, but Sho Lin will stay with the heroes for the moment and answer any questions they may have.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sho Lin takes over the meeting as President Moon leaves. <span class="p">Reading from her notes, Sho Lin provides the known details of Varrick’s disappearance. She tells the PCs that Varrick has</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sometimes excused himself from an official function for a secret meeting, but she couldn’t say with whom he was meeting. She tells the PCs that Varrick is most likely on some silly errand, but if he had been abducted, the culprit is likely the triads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">She thinks the PCs should start by rounding up and inter- rogating local triad members, maybe from the Terra Triad, and claims she has no other information at this time.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In truth, Sho Lin is interested only in having this situa- tion resolved as quickly, quietly, and easily as possible. <span class="p">If that means paying a ransom to some Triad members, so be it. She doesn’t want any of this to go public; whether Varrick is in danger or not, it would only make the administration look weak.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But after doing her own brief and efficient survey of the Box and surrounding areas, Sho Lin is fairly confident he is in actual danger, and has some theories about who might be involved.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">She doesn’t trust the PCs like Zhu Li does, however, and she is unwilling to share any information that might implicate the city government at all. Nor does she want to send these assorted mis- fits after a powerful figure like San Ho and provoke his anger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To see more on what she will share with the PCs, check out the “Clues” section of the Presidential Box in “Important Locations.”</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once Sho Lin leaves, the clock starts and the adventure begins. <span class="p">From this point forward, the PCs are on their own to find clues and stop the Triad from hurting Varrick and ruining Wakkanai.</span>
</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Looking for Evidence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, whenever the PCs look for information, they can find some clues by investigating using basic moves—<span class="s11">assessing a situ- ation</span>, talking to people and <span class="s11">pleading </span>with them or <span class="s11">tricking </span>them into revealing things, even <span class="s11">relying on skills and training </span>to come up with new discoveries. There are also some <b>leads </b>that point at a new route of investigation. The particulars of leads can change as needed to fit the specific game you’re playing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs can find clues as they look around, with or without using basic moves. For the leads, you can use the following move to determine what they find:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When the PCs thoroughly investigate an area for leads, they roll, modifying their results by the following questions:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Are they taking their time? If yes, mark a segment on the clock and take +1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Do they focus hard, and all of them mark 1-fatigue? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Are they free of pressure—not being hunted, attacked, or other- wise interfered with? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Are any of them familiar with the place? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a hit, they find one of the location’s leads—they choose a number between 1 and 3, and the GM gives them that lead. On a 10+, they find two leads; the PCs get to pick a second number and receive that lead as well. On a miss, they find one of the location’s leads, but it is particularly difficult to do so—they must each mark 1-fatigue or the GM marks a segment on the clock, PCs’ choice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Each of the main locations they might investigate has three</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">leads, all aimed at providing clear direction to new locations, cul- prits, and avenues of investigation.</p>
