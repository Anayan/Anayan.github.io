</p>
<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Korra Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi skillfully leads the Fire Nation into a brighter future, holding fast to the ideals of her father Zuko. The Fire Lord’s government uses an abundance of caution when it comes to military engagements or anything that has the potential to lead them closer to the nation’s old ways. As far as they are con- cerned, war is only an option when there are absolutely no other options left. Fire Lord Izumi only offered military help to the United Republic of Nations when Raiko, the former president, agreed to focus on defensive measures instead of aggressive ones in the fight against the Earth Empire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation government now looks inward to determine how they should be structured. Fire Lord Izumi is concerned not only about what best serves them now, but also what supports and serves them in the eras to come. She and many of her officials hope to soon invite the other nations to establish embassies within the capital of Hari Bulkan to continue foster- ing peaceful and cooperative relations. Before moving forward on that front, the government is removing the last of the Fire Nation monuments erected to honor those who perpetuated war crimes during the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Zuko is still alive and invested in the well-being of the Avatar and the world at large. Since stepping down as Fire Lord, he has made being an ambassador for the Fire Nation his first priority. Izumi’s son, Iroh, a general in the United Forces, helps to solidify the Fire Nation’s relationship with the United Republic of Nations. He and Izumi both see to it that the Fire Nation continues to make reparations for the damage done during the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cautious Fire Lord who is mindful of her nation’s history</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi is famous for her efforts to reform the Fire Nation’s government and cultivate peaceful relations with the other nations, including the United Republic of Nations. Her father Zuko shares her eagerness to continue moving away from the Fire Nation’s brutal past. Izumi is calm, rational, and steadfast, making decisions on behalf of the Fire Nation that not only take its well-being in mind, but the well-being of the rest of the world as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">She has little tolerance for jokes or levity in serious discus- sions, as she is determined to treat important decisions with the respect they deserve. Heroes who hail from the Fire Nation and serve the Fire Lord must conduct themselves with the utmost integrity, because their behavior reflects the nation as a whole. Izumi’s standards are high, and she is very particular about who she sends out into the world on the Fire Nation’s behalf.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dalja Ro</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The head of a special force dedicated to helping when disaster strikes <span class="p">Dalja Ro is the driven and tireless leader of the Fire Nation’s Relief Fleet. Dalja first inspired the fleet over a decade ago when they still served as an admiral in the Fire Navy. When a volcano erupted and devastated the village at its base, Dalja rerouted ships to rescue civilians and provide medical aid. The govern- ment was so impressed that they tasked Dalja with organizing</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a fleet dedicated to aiding civilians during disasters. Soon, the fleet was being dispatched to lend help after earthquakes, mine collapses, and tsunamis.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Dalja never turns down anyone who wants to help and is especially grateful when benders from other nations offer up their services. They often recruit graduates from the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, where they went to school. During their time at the Academy, Dalja realized they didn’t truly feel like a girl, and the support of their classmates helped shape Dalja into the person they are today. They remain an admiral in the Fire Navy, but the Fire Nation has committed to funding the Relief Fleet for actions throughout the world, anywhere that needs its help.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zuko</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The former Fire Lord who still seeks to help bring peace to the world <span class="p">Since he stepped down from the throne, Zuko lives on Ember Island, a famed vacation spot. He has hardly been living a life of pure serenity, however, as he’s kept himself busy supporting the policies of his daughter, Fire Lord Izumi, and promoting peace in the world. Outside of the Fire Nation, he is also heavily invested in the well-being of Republic City and the Southern Water Tribe.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Zuko is quick to act when he can be of service, often traveling long distances on his dragon, Druk, to lend aid. He was intense and impulsive in his youth, but now the former Fire Lord’s pas- sions are tempered by the years of wisdom under his belt, and he uses his experience to help wherever he can. Zuko’s priority is his family and if danger strikes, he’s there. Since Zuko carries</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a lot of clout, he can also pull some strings on a hero’s behalf, especially in the Fire Nation, Republic City, or the Southern Water Tribe.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Iroh</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A general in the United Forces with a strong moral compass</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Iroh, named after his great-granduncle, is a leader in the United Republic of Nations’ military and Fire Lord Izumi’s son. Iroh is charismatic and thoughtful with a kind heart and military mind like his late great uncle. Though part of the Fire Nation Royal Family, he serves in the United Forces and strictly follows his orders, even on the rare occasion when they go against the Avatar’s wishes. Despite that fact, Iroh and Korra have worked together more often than they’ve worked against each other.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Technically, Iroh is in line for the Fire Nation throne, but his status as a general in the United Forces makes that uncertain. Fire Lord Izumi’s goal to stay outside of military conflicts doesn’t always mesh with Iroh’s duties and the two sometimes disagree when it comes to the best course of action when the United Re- public calls on Fire Nation aid. Politicians and military advisors alike are curious to see what direction Iroh takes in the future; they wonder if he will continue his loyalty to the United Repub- lic, or if he will embrace his role as Fire Nation prince. If heroes need military backup or if they suspect a large-scale attack will be launched against the United Republic of Nations, they may want to turn to Iroh for help.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are difficult decisions to be made whenever other nations ask the Fire Nation to lend military assistance. Since the end of the Hundred Year War, the Fire Nation has tried to steer away from its heavily militarized history. Maintaining distance from the Fire Nation’s imperialist past means fighting against genera- tions-worth of history that has shaped the nation, and Fire Lord Izumi isn’t about to make any decisions about military matters lightly. Likewise, Izumi learned lessons from her father in caring for her people and knows the careful balancing act needed be- tween putting your people first and caring for the international community. Many officials and citizens in the Fire Nation feel similarly and support the Fire Lord’s decisions. Should anyone come to the Fire Nation for assistance from their armed forces, it had better be because they are the last possible resort.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Continuing Reparations</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked themes: Redemption</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation is dedicated to repairing as much harm from the Hundred Year War as possible, and they continue to take measures to do so to this day. For instance, the Fire Nation and Southern Water Tribe scholars work on a traveling showcase of tribal history to celebrate it throughout the world. Fire Nation officials have also done their best to return Air Nomad relics to the Air Acolytes and the burgeoning Air Nation, though some were destroyed or lost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Izumi continues her father’s practice of sending workers to assist in overseas construction projects and relief efforts as a natural outgrowth from their reparations work. Sometimes the other nations need a very specialized kind of help, like when dark spirits or extremist groups attack, or something im- portant is stolen. In these cases, Izumi may send heroes with spe- cialized experience and knowledge on behalf of the Fire Nation.</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked themes: Industrialization vs. Tradition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legend has it that dragons were the first Firebenders. Now, there are only three known dragons left in the world, and Zuko has met them all. When he was a teenager, he befriended Ran and Shaw on the Sun Warrior’s Island. In his 20s, he found a juvenile dragon he named Druk, who shared an ancestry with Ran and Shaw. Over the years, Druk grew up and became Zuko’s loyal companion, and the two of them flew around the world together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are people out there who specifically like to hunt rare, majestic animals, however, and if they take risks to capture sky bison, they are almost certainly willing to take big risks to cap- ture a creature as rare as a dragon. Additionally, conservationists may want to search the wilderness for possible undocumented dragons in order to establish a sanctuary for them. If any other dragons exist it could mean a new renaissance for the species.</p>
