<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The “Summary” holds the most important information you need to run <span class="s23">The Vanishing Act</span>; here is some additional advice you might find useful, including how to modify the adventure for different eras.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Fights in Ba Sing Se</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Getting into a fight in the Middle Ring of Ba Sing Se isn’t without its risks. Small skirmishes in side streets are likely to be overlooked—a lot of the action in the adventure takes place in gang territory after all. However, if characters start to throw arcs of fire through the streets of an upper-class district or set off smoke bombs obscuring a few market stalls, these actions aren’t without risk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Middle Ring is heavily populated—not overpopulated like the Lower Ring, but there are people everywhere. A big fight means that <span class="s23">civilians </span>are involved one way or another,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">probably as witnesses or innocent bystanders. If you use civilians as witnesses, they’re likely causing a direct problem for your players—they’re witnessing a fight that should be kept secret or running off to get the authorities. If you use civilians as innocent bystanders, you’re putting them in harm’s way and having your</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">players deal with the fallout. Maybe a foe grabs a civilian and uses them as a human shield, or maybe a merchant gets trapped in rubble while trying to flee the scene.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">police </span>are another obstacle your PCs may encounter depending on how a fight unfolds. Police could be called in by bystanders, drawn to chaos, or even just patrolling in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">neighborhood. Their first instinct is always to stop the fight, but they will quickly turn to finding someone to blame. If the police end up seriously hampering the players’ investigation (and in turn Ziming’s), the PCs might lose Ziming’s trust, as she’s trying to solve the case herself and other police may now be sniffing around. It’s even possible the local police force may be in the pocket of a faction the players encounter. For example, maybe the Paper Lanterns pay off the police force to look the other</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">way in their territory. After a fight with members of the Paper Lantern Gang, the players are surprised to find they’re the ones being arrested for disturbing the peace!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whether you decide to bring civilians and police into a fight is up to you and the scene unfolding around the PCs. If bringing in one of these two groups feels like too much to handle or keep track of, don’t do it. Maybe everyone just runs away, and maybe the police turn a blind eye to the chaos. Use the police and civil- ians as interesting ways to add drama to your game, not to stress yourself out!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Members of the Flying Koi Carnival are secretly thieves, and Rose and Hua’s relationship is a secret, but secrets aren’t worth anything to you as a GM if they don’t come into play during the game. As GM, you might be tempted to guard the characters’ secrets the way those characters would guard them!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rather than treating the NPCs’ secrets as something your players should never know, treat them as delicious morsels to drop at just the right times to keep your players wanting more. If the players bust into the Stone Kettle demanding that the Paper Lantern Gang hand over Rose, have Hua stand up, shocked that her girlfriend was kidnapped! If the players decide to investigate Lei’s house for clues, have Maolo and Anri there giving a private “paintbending” show for diplomatic guests…whom they just so happen to (obviously) steal from throughout the show.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Use the secrets you know to add fun hooks to your game, and let the players in on the mystery, or better yet make them responsible for it. They can’t let anyone know about Hua and Rose; it could ruin their chance to run away together. They can never tell anyone that the Flying Koi Carnival are thieves—the Flying Koi use the money they steal to feed the poor and the starving! Twist the secrets into moral choices for your players and push on their principles to see what they decide to do.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">One-Shot Adventuring</p>
<p class="s23" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Vanishing Act <span class="p">is a perfect start for a campaign, but it also works pretty well as a one-shot adventure, a single episode you can use if you’re only going to play with a group one time; here are some tips on how to run this adventure as a one-shot:</span>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ramp up the action</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You’ve only got a single session to make your story awesome, so jump in with both feet. If someone might escalate to a fight, have them throw the first punch; if you want the players to find a clue, make it obvious and apparent. Anything that doesn’t show up in this first session isn’t ever going to show up, so get to it!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Use the factions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The factions are one of your best tools for keeping the action moving. Make sure the PCs are tied to Rose’s story and care about her kidnapping, but never let them forget that the factions have agendas of their own—when the PCs start sniffing around, make sure everyone has a theory for what happened to Rose. Use those conflicting perspectives to give the companions lots to do and several different groups of allies they could enlist for help.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Hit hard with fatigue, balance shifts, etc.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many mechanical elements of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>really shine when they have time to show up repeatedly on screen. It’s hard for a PC to <span class="s11">lose their balance</span>, for example, if their balance only shifts once in the whole one-shot. Push the PCs hard with these elements so that their choices matter!</p>

<a href="part99.htm#bookmark241" class="s25">Good luck! Don’t forget the advice in the “Introduction” on getting the game set up and check out additional one-shot tips on page 249</a> for more on running great one-shot adventures!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Different Eras</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If your game isn’t set in the Aang Era, you can still use this adventure! In most eras, much of the content can be used as is—subtly adjusting the characters and factions to match the time period—but you may want to change Rose and her family’s story to something that fits the era. Rose’s mixed heritage and her desire to return to the countryside with Hua exemplifies</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">one of the themes of the Aang Era: Coexistence. If you’re setting this adventure in a different era, link Rose’s struggle to one of its themes to provide motivation for her actions, such as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Kyoshi Era</span>—<i>Justice and Revenge</i>—Lei is a corrupt Earth Kingdom official, and Rose wants to get away from her overbearing mother.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Roku Era</span>—<i>Connection vs. Isolation</i>—It’s an exciting time to be alive! Rose wants to explore the world and visit the other three nations together with her girlfriend!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Hundred Year War</span>—<i>Hope in Rebellion</i>—Rose knows a war is happening outside the walls of Ba Sing Se, and while she isn’t dumb enough to broadcast that in the Middle Ring, she wants to get out of the city and help fight the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Korra Era</span>—<i>Setting Boundaries</i>—Rose has led a sheltered life, and she wants some freedom from her family to see what she can do when she stands on her own two feet.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you want to make more radical era-specific changes, try:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Kyoshi Era: </span>Change the Flying Koi and Paper Lantern Gang into <i>daofei </i>who once were members of the same gang but split when Cong seized control from Peng. Peng left for a time with a few members of the gang who stayed loyal to him, Maolo, and Anri…but now Peng wants his territory back and is willing to do anything</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to achieve his goals, which include manipulating the other forces in the city to help him take Cong down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Roku Era: </span>Change the Flying Koi Carnival into secret spies for the Queen of Omashu and make Ziming an agent for the crown who suspects the carnival workers of spying. Lei is a high-ranking Earth Kingdom official who is deeply loyal to Earth King Jialun, giving the carnival all the more motivation to kidnap Rose. The carnival members have to deal with not only the Paper Lantern Gang, whose constant harassment is threatening to blow their cover,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">but also a nosy detective who knows too much…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Hundred Year War Era: </span>In this era, the Flying Koi Carnival could be a group of rebels trying to expose the war outside Ba Sing Se’s walls. Rose is a revolutionary, and her mother (as a high minister) knows that all is not well outside Ba Sing Se. Maybe Rose and Hua’s escape plan is to join up with the circus and leave Ba Sing Se once the carnival’s plan is complete, but Rose is taken to be reeducated by the Dai Li.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Korra Era: </span>Set the adventure in Republic City! Change the Paper Lantern Gang to the Paper Lantern Triad and the Flying Koi members into secret equalists (which also requires turning a number of the characters into non- benders). The Flying Koi’s goal is then not to give money to the poor, but to stoke anti-bending sentiment by performing crimes and pinning them on benders…and what better target than the already criminal Paper Lantern Triad?</p>
