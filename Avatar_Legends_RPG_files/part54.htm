<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moves are the core of playing <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Whenever a player takes an action that triggers an appro- priate move, or something happens in the game that triggers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a move, you pick up the dice, roll, and follow what the move describes! If something isn’t a move, you don’t roll—either it happens or the GM makes their own move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Moves are broken up into <span class="s23">basic moves </span>that every charac- ter can make, <span class="s23">playbook moves </span>unique to each playbook, and moves related to specific parts of the game that need their own categories, like <span class="s23">combat moves</span>. This chapter describes how and when to make the moves most central to the game—ba- sic moves and balance moves—as well as how to run combat exchanges with techniques. For information on individual play- book moves, see <span class="s23">Chapter 6: Playbooks</span>.</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using Moves in Play</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A <span class="s23">move </span>is an action with a trigger and one or more outcomes that “move” the game forward. The trigger tells you how and when to make that move, like “When you <span class="s11">push your luck </span>in a risky situa- tion<span class="s65">…</span>” or “When you <span class="s11">assess a situation</span>…” If you meet the crite- ria of a move’s trigger, you’re making that move! Follow the rest of the move to find out if you need to roll the dice or not—and if so, which stat to add to your roll—as well as what happens next.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Some playbook moves give you a bonus instead of having a trigger (like giving you +1 to a stat) or give you access to an in-game asset or effect (like having an animal companion)—those moves functionally say “when you select this playbook move, take +1 to a stat” or “gain a clever animal companion.” Most of the moves in the game, however, follow the format “When you <u>&nbsp; </u>, roll with a stat.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM has final say on whether or not you trigger a move, as well as which move you trigger. If you do something in the game that triggers a move, they should call for you to make it (“That sounds like you’re <span class="s11">intimidating this NPC</span>, right? Go ahead and roll with your <span class="s52">Passion</span>!”). If you’re uncertain which move you should be making, or if you think you’re making a different move than what the GM called for, talk to the GM and make sure your character’s intent with their actions or words is clear before moving forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">There are two key phrases to keep in mind when playing <span class="s13">Av- atar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>—<span class="s23">always follow the fiction</span>, and <span class="s23">to do it, you need to do it</span>.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Always Follow the Fiction</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you describe what your character does and says, the GM responds by describing what NPCs say and do, as well as how the world responds—this is the “conversation” of the game. At some point, you’ll come to a situation where the outcome of your action is uncertain or dangerous, or otherwise <i>triggers </i>one of the game’s moves. When that happens, turn to the triggered move, roll the dice (or not, depending on the move), and do what the move says.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part90.htm#bookmark224" class="s25">If you describe an action that doesn’t trigger a move, there’s no need to roll any dice—it wasn’t a move, and there’s no uncertain- ty! The GM might say that you do it outright, or they might make a GM move of their own in response, according to their agendas, guidelines, and baselines (see page 224</a> for more). In this way, you’re <i>always following the fiction </i>by focusing on what’s happening in the story and turning to the game mechanics as they come up.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">To Do It, Do It</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you want to make a specific move, you can—you just need to describe what you’re doing and how you’re doing it. Make sure you actually hit the trigger of a move before reaching for the dice! Do you want to try to <span class="s11">plead with an NPC </span>to get them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to help you? You need to do more than just ask them for a favor, and they need to care what you think! Want to <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>to slip a guard’s keys off their belt without being noticed? Describe how you use your training (like a bending maneuver) or your skills (like an Outlaw background as a pick- pocket) to accomplish your goal!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In some cases, your action might actually trigger a different move than the one you wanted—a sheltered monk who tries to pick a pocket is probably <span class="s11">pushing their luck </span>instead of <span class="s11">relying on skills and training</span>. Even if you want the results or effects of a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">move, you need to do more than just say “I make this move” and roll the dice—<i>you need to do it to do it</i>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a player, focus more on describing what your character does first and turn to the moves as you find yourself making them. However, it’s totally fine to try and angle your actions and roleplaying towards making certain moves—especially your cool and unique playbook moves! Just remember that you need to <i>do it to do it</i>, so make sure you take actions that trigger those moves if you want to use them. Remember, there are no rolls without a specific trigger or outcome—if your actions haven’t triggered a move, keep playing until you finally trigger one.</p>
