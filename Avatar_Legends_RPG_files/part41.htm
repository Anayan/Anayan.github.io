<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska lead the Northern Water Tribe since their father died trying to kill the Avatar, but it can be hard for some people to trust in leaders who are so young. What’s worse is that some citizens of the Northern Water Tribe may look at the twins and see two children who betrayed their father instead of two leaders who made the correct decision in a difficult situation. The twins are also not the most personable leaders and their acerbic wit can make for tense political situations. With the world in flux, it may be the perfect time for conspirators in the Northern Water Tribe to strike at their leaders and take over. Desna and Eska are skilled Waterbenders who can defend themselves, but they may need help if someone corrupt attempts to usurp them or makes them seem incompetent.</p>

<a href="part40.htm#bookmark98" class="s25">These two portals caused a lot of trouble for the Avatar a few years ago during the civil war, and they remain points of interest for those looking to take advantage of or harm the Spirit World. The spirit portal in Republic City is guarded by the Air Nomads now, but the two original portals are not as strictly protected since they sit out in the wild, in the middle of frigid wastelands. But these natural barriers have become less of a deterrent as technology advances past anyone’s expectations. Unlike centu- ries before, the tribes in charge of protecting these portals are pulled in new directions balancing a modern world with their spiritual duties. Cunning businessmen like Wonyong Keum (page 82)</a> may think of new ways to exploit the portals for money, though any such plans are almost guaranteed to backfire.</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes have traditionally accepted same-sex relation- ships so long as people keep them quiet. Now that Avatar Korra and Asami are out about their relationship, they may inspire other queer Water Tribe members to come out as well. This has also led to many of the younger generation in the Northern Wa- ter Tribe question the relevance of their parents arranging their marriages for them. It’s a modern world to them and people should be able to love who they want confidently and proudly. Traditionalists may not take well to this more open behavior, while those quietly supportive may struggle to vocalize their support for fear of ostracization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska have made it clear that gender plays no role</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in deciding who can and cannot marry each other. When they receive pushback against this decree, they have been known to make more personal appearances at same-sex weddings shortly after. Some believe that they do this just to amuse themselves, but those close to the twin rulers know that they truly support these relationships and aren’t going to change their minds.</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Korra Era sees the rise of a new phenomenon—the corporation—giant international companies that pro- vide goods and services across the globe. This new age means people can get things faster than ever before and corporations use their resources to ensure they’re the</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">ones getting new products to consumers rather than their competitors. Some news sources even speculate that the rise of these large conglomerations could mean the death of local business, but the era is young and who knows where the future will lead? A few of the largest corpora- tions are Future Industries, Cabbage Corp, and of course Varrick Global Industries.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Headed by the infamous Southern Water Tribe busi- nessman Varrick, Varrick Global Industries is the premier corporation for technological development. It develops the best, most innovative inventions, devices that are both practical and delightful. One of the most famous inventions by Varrick and used by his company was mov- ers (movies), which began as propaganda, but are now embraced as an a popular form of entertainment.</p>
