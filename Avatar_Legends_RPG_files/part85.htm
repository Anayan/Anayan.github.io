<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to growth advancements, every PC in <span class="s13">Avatar Leg- ends: The Roleplaying Game </span>can improve themselves in another way—by learning and mastering new advanced techniques. Learning advanced techniques represents a character’s skills growing, as they become capable of performing new and impressive feats consistently within combat and more powerful and dynamic uses of their training in general.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">All player characters start play with all nine basic techniques mastered. In fact, every fighter in this game has mastered all nine basic techniques, based on their training. Any NPC who doesn’t have all nine basic techniques mastered is not a trained fighter</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at the level of most in <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, but might be a student or an ordinary citizen who doesn’t have much cause to practice their bending in combat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Advanced techniques, on the other hand, are more sophis- ticated, more complicated, and often more powerful than</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">basic techniques. They represent complex, specific sequences of movements and corresponding states of mind and will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any Firebender can conjure a fire, and likely blast a fireball; but only some Firebenders are trained in creating the dread- ed fire pinwheel!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Learning Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a PC learns techniques in <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, they always learn advanced techniques. A player character first gains an advanced technique at <span class="s23">learned </span>level, then improves it to <span class="s23">practiced </span>level, and finally to <span class="s23">mastered </span>level:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Learned </span>techniques: the PC has learned the basics and can replicate this technique some of the time. They still need practice and additional understanding to really master this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Practiced </span>techniques: the PC has learned and successfully applied the technique in a stressful combat situation. They have a greater ability to call upon it with ease and efficacy, but have yet to fully master</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">it; they still can’t call upon the technique at will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Mastered </span>techniques: the PC has gained full control and can perform the technique at will, consistently, every time, without question, just like the basic techniques. To master a technique, the PC must fulfill a <span class="s23">mastery condition</span>, some special task set to them by their teacher (often when the character first learns the technique, but sometimes set much later).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mastering a new technique is often an important part of your character’s journey; it might prompt them to seek out a teacher and contend with new and difficult challenges. For example, Sokka’s desire to master the sword led him to study under Piand- ao, a master swordsman from the Fire Nation who challenged the young Sokka to grow considerably in both his sword training and his strategic thinking. Training allows your character to be guided in this journey, mastering new techniques under the eyes of a watchful teacher and mentor.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Types of Advanced Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The full list of advanced techniques can be found in <span class="s23">Appendix A: Techniques</span>. Within that broader list of techniques, there are a few different types:</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Universal Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any technique that can be learned by all characters, regardless of training, is a <span class="s23">universal technique</span>. These techniques tend to focus on broad strategies during a combat exchange, such as</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">charging an opponent or protecting an ally. All trainings that are not universal are keyed to a specific training, such as waterbend- ing techniques or technology techniques—they can only be learned by a character with that particular training.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">NPCs without highly distinctive fighting styles usually use universal techniques, but remember that they always make use of their training—an Earthbender who uses a universal tech- nique in a combat exchange is still using earthbending.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Group Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part94.htm#bookmark231" class="s25">Some techniques can only appear when used by groups of NPCs (page 237);</a> these are <span class="s23">group techniques</span>. PCs can never learn group techniques—even if they fight as a group, each individual PC still retains their ability to act independently and choose their own techniques—so these techniques are only for the GM to use when designing group NPCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can expect virtually all group NPCs to feature at least one group technique. These techniques are specifically created to help the GM represent a group fighting together, swarming their opponents to try to get the upper hand or scattering and withdrawing to avoid the PCs’ blows.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Rare Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Techniques that are particularly powerful and potent are often <span class="s23">rare techniques</span>, closely guarded secrets that masters only share with their most trusted students. Such techniques are notably more powerful than other techniques; learning them often requires a student to build a relationship with the master and mastering them often requires considerably more work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">NPCs who have mastered rare techniques are, well, rare. But they are also the only NPCs who can serve as teachers for these potent abilities.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Specialized Bending Techniques</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, some <span class="s23">specialized bending techniques </span>require charac- ters to have mastered specialized forms of bending—like healing or lightningbending—in order to learn them. Each of these techniques is marked with the specialized bending form, such</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part86.htm#bookmark209" class="s25">as “lavabending” or “metalbending.” You can read more about learning and mastering specialized bending forms on page 216.</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In early eras, many forms of specialized bending are virtually nonexistant, but later eras feature many characters who have mastered metalbending, lightningbending, lavabending, and more. While NPCs who have mastered these techniques are always potent foes, you can expect their rarity to be directly related to the era you’ve chosen for your game.</p>

<a name="bookmark206">Training &amp; Techniques</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you want to learn a new technique, first you need some way to do so. Some playbooks have special ways to learn tech- niques (like the Prodigy), but most need a teacher, someone who has already mastered the technique and is willing and capable of teaching it. Player characters can’t, in general, teach each other techniques, even if they’ve mastered them; they are still finding themselves and seeking balance, so they aren’t ready to be teachers yet. They have to find teachers out in the world, be they local craftspeople who have mastered some specific use of firebending, or the greatest swordswoman in the entire world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember that you can only learn techniques appropriate for your own training, by default. Some playbooks have ways to get around this, but most Firebenders can only learn techniques that are either universal or specific to firebending, for example. It doesn’t help a Firebender to learn how to create walls of ice!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Your teacher must have mastered the technique they’re teaching you. Mechanically, this means that you aren’t going to be taught by a student, someone who’s still learning—they’re liable to impart the wrong lessons. But within the game, masters abound! The local Waterbender angler likely has mastered tech- niques to aid in her day-to-day job, but those techniques are still valuable to learn and quite possibly effective in a fight—so she’d be a great master!</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you find a teacher who knows the technique and agrees to teach you, then you can use the following move.</p>

</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you spend time with a teacher learning and training in a new technique, roll with modifiers from the following questions:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of conditions? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Do you and your teacher share at least one background? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training and learning? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, and skills? If no, take -1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a hit, you learn the technique, and your master shifts your balance. On a 10+, you learn it with ease, and it takes as little time as possible. On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark two conditions. On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need another lesson before you can grasp its full use. Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, and you learn the technique.</p>

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Basic Elements of the Training Move</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Spend time with a teacher learning and training in a new tech- nique” <span class="p">means that you must both have a teacher, and you must have time. You can’t learn a technique in the middle of combat (without special moves). The amount of time may vary, especially based on the results of the move, but a good rule of thumb is to expect at least half a day, if not more. Furthermore, you need to have the teacher’s attention for a significant por- tion of that time; training is more than just a quick lesson and a day of practice on your own.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you roll, you don’t add one of your stats. Instead, you answer the four provided questions. Two of them provide a +1 if you answer “yes,” and two of them impose a -1 if you answer “no.” Total up the balance of these questions and roll with that total, taking into account all of the answers.</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of condi- tions” <span class="p">means that you learn better when you’re stable, in control of yourself, in balance. The </span>“or” <span class="p">in the question means that if you satisfy either question, you get the +1. So, if your balance is in line with your center you get a +1, or if you have no conditions marked you get a +1.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you and your teacher share at least one background” <span class="p">means that you have a slightly easier time learning from a teacher with whom you share something in common. You aren’t penalized for being different, but the similarity can smooth the way forward— so if you answer yes to this question, you get a +1 on the move.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training and learning” <span class="p">means your teacher both understands why you want to train—the real reason, not any lies or half-truths you might have tried to use on them—and approves. In rare circumstances, your teacher might still understand your reasons for training with- out you explaining. You might even have lied to your teacher, only for them to see through your lies! But the vast majority of the time, if you’ve obscured your reasons, your teacher won’t know the real reasons and thus can’t agree with them. When your teacher doesn’t agree with your reasons for learning, they have a harder time teaching you—there’s a fundamental divide between you that makes the training more difficult. So, when the answer to this question is no, you take a -1 on the move.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, and skills?” <a href="part86.htm#bookmark209" class="s25">means that difficult, complicated, or strange techniques are harder to learn. More powerful techniques are generally more complicated to grasp. Similarly, rare techniques may be even more complicated to grasp, and techniques tied to specialized forms of bending that the PC hasn’t learned yet— metalbending techniques, bloodbending techniques, combustion- bending techniques—are the hardest. (For more on specialized bending, see page 216.)</a>
<span class="p"> The GM is the final arbiter of whether</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the technique is easy to grasp or not but should focus on the extent of the PC’s skills and all the techniques they’ve learned so far. In general, if there is any doubt about whether the technique should be within the PC’s grasp, then the answer to this question is “no”, and would impose a -1 on the roll.</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WhAT IS AN ATTACK?</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Many special techniques reference attacks, such as “whenever you <i>attack</i>” or “a character who <i>attacked </i>you this exchange.” In all cases, an attack is any aggressive, physical move against a target</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">during an exchange that attempts to directly inflict a condition, fatigue, balance shifts, or negative status. Actions that indirectly harm a target, such as smashing the ground beneath someone or trying to trap someone under a tree are not attacks, even if they inflict fatigue or a status like <i>Trapped</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Results of the Training Move</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“On a hit, you learn the technique and your master shifts your balance” <span class="p">means that you take the technique at learned level, and your mas- ter can shift your balance in whichever direction they choose— taking up their lessons does shift your balance at least a bit.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark two conditions” <span class="p">gives you a hard choice. If you mark two conditions, you come out of the training emotionally frustrated or thrown, but successful. If you take more time than normal, how- ever, you’re handing the GM a golden opportunity to make a GM move, to say that something happens while you’re busy training that you can’t affect, stop, or interfere with. It might leave you out of a fight that embroils your fellow companions; it might be some- thing terrible happening to the local town. Be prepared!</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">“On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need an- other lesson before you can grasp its full use” <span class="p">means exactly that— you can’t complete your training right here, right now, without additional effort. </span>“Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, and you learn the technique” <span class="p">means that your master will give you some other duty or task. That task takes you on a journey, changing your mind and leading you to new understanding, but allowing you to actually learn the technique in full. As soon as you complete the task, you get the technique at learned level, but the GM is the arbiter of whether or not the task is complete.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the GM assigns you a task, it relates in some way to the nature of the technique, and the lessons the teacher might have to teach about the world, people, and balance. It doesn’t have to be as complicated as a mastery condition (see below)—it’s usu- ally something you can do within a session—but that framework can be useful for thinking about appropriate tasks.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Tasks:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Apologize to another player character, honestly and truly, for some wrongdoing</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Work to aid, help, or save an NPC who desperately needs it</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Journey to a nearby location of spiritual or historical prominence, and study it or meditate on it</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Obtain a local resource and deliver it to the teacher or another NPC</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Agree with the teacher, honestly, about some rule or restriction on future action</p>

<a name="bookmark207">Improving Techniques</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part59.htm#bookmark151" class="s25">After you have learned a technique—marking it on your play- book at learned level—you can now use it in combat exchanges, but only if you roll a 10+ on the stance move (page 148)</a> and mark an additional fatigue. Those are some high bars! The good news, however, is that you can improve your control and ability to use the technique. You can take your learned technique and make it practiced; and you can take your practiced technique and master it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But improving techniques requires you to do some work on your own! While learning a technique requires you to find a teacher willing to train you, advancing your knowledge further requires you to go beyond direct instruction, practicing the technique during combat exchanges and (eventually) working to understand the technique at a new level through the mastery conditions your teacher sets for you.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Going from Learned to Practiced</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To take your technique from learned level to practiced level, you have to use it once—just once!—in combat. That means rolling a 10+ on the <span class="s11">stance move</span>, and paying the additional cost of 1-fa- tigue (beyond any cost the technique itself might impose). But as soon as you’ve done that once, the technique is at practiced level. That means you’ve used it and you can call on it imme- diately, even in the very next combat exchange—not with the same simple ease as a mastered technique, but more easily than at learned. A practiced technique can be used when you roll a 10+ on the <span class="s11">stance move</span>, without paying any additional cost.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Going from Practiced to Mastered</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To take your technique from practiced level to mastered level, you have to overcome a higher bar. You have to fulfill a mastery condition, as set to you by your teacher. A mastery condition is a special task to teach you a further lesson, to help you shift your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mind and balance to a place where you can gain total control and mastery over the particular technique you’re focused on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To learn what your mastery condition must be for the technique, you must have a teacher—you have to have someone to guide you. Your mastery condition is also specifically <i>yours</i>. Every mastery con- dition is suited to the technique, the teacher, and the student. The condition represents what the teacher thinks the student must learn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most of the time, you can get a mastery condition as soon as you learn the technique. Usually, the GM assigns you just such a mastery condition after you have successfully taken the tech-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nique at learned level. But you can also get the mastery condition later, especially from more crotchety, ornery teachers who prefer you master the basics (i.e. go from learned to practiced level) before they even tell you the mastery condition. No matter what, however, a teacher, specifically, sets the mastery condition—and a different teacher might set a different mastery condition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Setting a mastery condition requires the GM to think about the PC, the teacher, and what the teacher might want the character to learn, especially in context of this particular technique. A tech- nique about overwhelming, defeating power taught by a quiet, unassuming monk to a brash, aggressive Hammer might lead the teacher to ask the Hammer to submit, to surrender to a dangerous foe—the lesson of defeat is crucial for the student to understand how to use that force on a foe. A technique about evasive action taught by a master thief to a boisterous, fun-loving Icon might lead the teacher to ask the Icon to purposefully make others angry with them, and then to escape from those dangerous situations—the lesson of ever-more-difficult, ever-more-dangerous evasion push- ing the student to understand how to get away from trouble.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">GMs should think about the following when setting a mas-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">tery condition:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• What are the PC’s principles, and how does the teacher see them? If the teacher sees the character as too far one way or the other on the balance track, the teacher could set them a mastery condition to push the other way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What does the player character care about? If the teacher thinks the character cares too much about the wrong thing, or too little about the right thing, the teacher can set them a mastery condition that pushes them to change their priorities.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What is the PC’s personality like? If the character is too much of one thing (too aggressive, too quiet, too afraid, too serious), the teacher might set them a mastery condition that pushes them to act differently, to feel differently.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, nearly any task can be a good mastery condition, just so long as it’s interesting and leads to fun new stories; it relates to the PC specifically, connecting to their issues and sources of drama; and it’s a challenge to accomplish, but certainly not impossible.</p>

<a name="bookmark208">Example Mastery Conditions:</a>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Defeat a specific foe in combat</b>—useful for when the player character would otherwise run from that foe or has difficulty standing up for themselves. <i>Example: Defeat the leader of the Red Ribbon Bandits, who destroyed your home.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Surrender</b>—useful for when the PC is bold or overly brave and needs to learn a lesson in humility. Add “to a specific foe” to push them to a particular enemy they only ever want to fight. <i>Example: Surrender to the Chief of Police</i>
</p>
<p class="s43" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of Republic City and face them with head held high.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Lose your balance</b>—useful for an overly careful player character, who never loses their balance, whose center has not shifted over many sessions of play. Add “in a specific situation” to make it more directed. <i>Example: Lose your balance in an argument with a powerful figure.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Be taken out</b>—useful for when the PC always deals with their conditions before they can threaten to overwhelm them, when they need to learn not to run from their feelings. Add “in a specific situation” to make it more directed. <i>Example: Be taken out outside of combat.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Seek a specific mystical or ancient location</b>—useful for when the overall group of companions travels quite a bit, and when the technique is strange or draws on lost wisdom. <i>Example: Seek the Sun Warriors in their hidden city and learn from them.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Return an important artifact to its proper place</b>—useful for when the player character doesn’t attach to places</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">or the people in them, and needs to learn a lesson about preservation and protection. <i>Example: Return the spirit tome to its place of prominence in the Eastern Air Temple.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Find and listen to an opposing teacher</b>—useful for when the teacher presents a highly polarized view of the world, and the PC needs to learn the lessons at the opposing end of the spectrum. <i>Example: Find the only other student of the same teacher and let them complete your training.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• <b>Build a structure of spiritual or local import</b>—useful for when the player character is much more of a fighter or a destroyer, or even an evader who tends to run from problems, than a builder who constructs. Add “with/without using particular tools”</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">to make it more poignant or challenging. <i>Example: Construct defenses around the whole of the village without your bending.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Destroy a dangerous or corrupt structure</b>—useful for when the PC is more prone to careful, comforting, pleasant, harmonious solutions, and refuses to solve problems, even intractable ones, by bowling them over. <i>Example: Destroy the local polluting factory.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Tell a specific person a specific, difficult truth</b>—useful for when the player character’s issues have a lot to do with making decisions, or trying to hide things about themselves. <i>Example: Admit to your other teachers that you, an Icon, don’t want to fulfill your Role.</i>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• <b>Use the technique in an exchange in a particular way</b>— useful for when the player character is reluctant to make use of an advanced technique or when the technique</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">is particularly powerful or focused. <i>Example: Defeat an opponent using this technique as the final blow.</i>
</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Using Techniques Outside of Combat</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Techniques are always combat-oriented in their ef- fects, but if you’ve mastered a technique, then you can always perform it fairly easily. If you want to do that thing outside of combat, you can! It might be a move like <b>rely on your skills and training </b>if there are other uncertainties at play, but when you’ve mastered a technique, the uncertainty is no longer “Am I skilled enough to actually do this?”</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Techniques represent a set of highly-ingrained skills and proficiencies suited for rapid, instantaneous action in the middle of a fight, as well—so some techniques represent abilities you could use regu- larly outside of combat, but are pretty tough to use easily in combat.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">For example, the earthbending technique of Tun- neling refers to quickly diving into the earth and popping back out with speed and accuracy. If you don’t have the technique, you can’t do it as well in combat…but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it at all outside of combat! Most likely, if you lacked the</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">technique, you’d be <b>relying on your skills and train- ing </b>or <b>pushing your luck </b>to do it outside of combat. And if you had the technique mastered, there might be times when you tunnel outside of combat with no uncertainty at all—you can definitely tunnel pretty well, so without other factors at play creat- ing uncertainty, you just do it!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Lessons From Other Trainings</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, all advanced techniques—except universal tech- niques—are tied to a particular training like Airbending or Weapons, and can only be learned by a character who possesses that training. Characters who have two trainings, such as one who took the Successor’s <span class="s11">Worldly Knowledge </span>move, can learn techniques from each training. Learning techniques without the appropriate training requires a specific move or feature like the Prodigy’s <span class="s11">An Open Mind </span>move that allows you to adapt the specific techniques of a different training to your own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">
<a href="part165.htm#bookmark411" class="s25">If you want to learn a specific technique outside your train- ing, it’s possible to work with your GM to develop a technique for your training that works in a similar way. For example, you might convert Water Whip (page 282)</a> to Fire Whip, using the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">technique’s mechanics to represent a quick burst of fire similar to a Waterbender’s tendril of water.</p>
