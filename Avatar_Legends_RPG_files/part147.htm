</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether you’re playing this adventure as a one-shot or part of an ongoing campaign, the PCs need a reason to be in Boat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bottom. The goal of this introduction is to build rapport amidst the PCs, worldbuild a reason for the companions to be in Boat Bottom, and establish an exciting event that draws Qian Yu’s attention. Rather than give the PCs a reason to be in the village, have the players create it themselves and along the way craft an exciting event Qian Yu witnesses. If you’re using the pregens, they arrive in Boat Bottom looking for Qian Yu, and you should ignore the first two questions.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• You needed to find something in Boat Bottom; what was it and why was it so vital?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The object of your search wasn’t easy to find or obtain; who or what stood in your way?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What first went terribly wrong during your search?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• (Ask each player) What did you do to contribute to saving the day?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• (If using unique characters) In the end, you succeeded in finding and obtaining what you were looking for.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What cost did you pay for that success? What aspect of your victory earned you renown as heroes?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How thoroughly impressive! It’s no wonder Qian Yu approached the companions and told them of her plight. She described her plight and requested the PCs’ help. Ask each player:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• (If you’re using unique characters) Why did you agree to help?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• (If you’re using the pregens) Why did you agree to help despite needing the money from the bounty?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve established why the companions are here and com- mitted to helping Qian Yu, move right into the action below!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Getting Started</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First the companions and Qian Yu need to get out of Boat Bottom. Qian Yu brings them to the Jelly Shack and her hiding place; on their way, they duck into an alleyway when they see Sparrowkeet Air guards combing the city. Just as the coast is clear a tall man in a bulky coat bumps into Qian Yu. She recovers to realize he stole the artifact! The PCs need to get the artifact back fast, before the guards notice the commotion. The tall man is in fact two young thieves (see Flint and Ember in “Important Characters”) who wouldn’t be that much of a problem if not for the fact that the city is now crawling with guards.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Stealing the Artifact</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This opening situation is a fun, exciting scene that gets the PCs into the action quickly. Use this incident to get the players trig- gering moves and making choices. But keep in mind that the PCs and Qian Yu need the artifact to deliver and carry forward! It’s an obvious source of drama, to steal the artifact or threaten to de- stroy it throughout play…but if it actually is stolen or destroyed, then the adventure is over. Don’t deploy this kind of threat too of- ten, and don’t resist the PCs recovering or protecting the artifact; it’s far more interesting to see what costs they pay to succeed in these situations than to see what they do when they fail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part148.htm#bookmark358" class="s25">In particular here, Flint and Ember aren’t especially vicious or dangerous foes, and the PCs shouldn’t need any kind of pitched battle to a terrible end to get the two to surrender—indeed, a fight might not even be necessary at all. The two boys might return the artifact for many reasons—see more on them on page 150</a> to see why they might give it back!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once the PCs recover the artifact, it is up to them where they want to go. The most likely location is the Dirigible Site, but let the players lead the action and see where they want to go!</p>
