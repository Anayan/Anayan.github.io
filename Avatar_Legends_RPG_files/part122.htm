<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This scenario introduces several conflicts at once, all of which come to a head in the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. Below are the main points of the story in brief, to get you acquainted with what’s going on. At the heart of this adventure are these groups, all vying with each other:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• The Ambassador, her guard Tan, and Tan’s Firebender guards, who all want to find the kidnapped children as quickly as possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The anti-corruption task force of Yong and his Earthbenders, who use the kidnapping as an excuse to round up</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">criminals but care little if the children are found.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Lei Fang, Hana, and the Fanged Mercenaries, who kidnapped the children, framed the ex-<i>daofei </i>vigilante Mengyao for</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the kidnapping, and are using the ensuing chaos for crime.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Mengyao the vigilante, who is trying to clear her name.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three days ago, <b>Ambassador Quin’s </b>children went missing from a teahouse in the Middle Ring of Ba Sing Se. The only evidence left at the scene of the crime was a unique arrow belonging to the notorious vigilante and ex-<i>daofei </i>Mengyao, which was found lodged in a stone wall. Ambassador Quin is a longstanding Fire Nation official in the Earth Kingdom; she even keeps a residence in the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. She has been involved in Earth Kingdom politics on behalf of the Fire Nation for five years and has worked in the Earth Kingdom long enough to be aware of how the magistrates and Earth Sages work.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Tan and his Firebenders <span class="p">work for Ambassador Quin and are searching for the missing children. Ambassador Quin doesn’t trust the Earth Kingdom anti-corruption task force to prioritize her children, and she isn’t far off. Not only is the task force dragging its feet, but its leader seems to see the Fire Nation guards as a threat.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<b>Yong and the anti-corruption task force </b>are Earthbenders tasked with rooting out corrupt individuals and criminals in Ba Sing Se. Yong was already cracking down on the <i>daofei </i>in the Low- er Ring, but the kidnapping is the perfect excuse to go in, clean house, and win himself accolades for leading the charge. Yong</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">isn’t worried about finding the children. He believes that sooner or later he’ll arrest someone who knows where the children are, and then he can rescue them and arrest Mengyao. The only thing he has to do until then is ensure the Firebenders don’t find the children first and embarrass him before his plan comes to fruition.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao <span class="p">is innocent of the crime she is accused of and searches for the missing children in order to clear her name. She suspects Lei Fang and Hana have set her up, but she needs evidence to clear her name.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<b>Lei Fang and Hana</b>, leader and second-in-command of the Fanged Mercenaries, are setting up other <i>daofei </i>for crimes they did not commit in order to use the anti-corruption task force’s momentum to remove rivals. They have <b>kidnapped the ambas- sador’s children and framed Mengyao </b>in order to remove her from the equation.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though Mengyao was once a <i>daofei </i>who stole from the rich of Ba Sing Se, she is now a vigilante, targeting dangerous crimi- nals in Ba Sing Se and helping to bring them down so they can’t harm innocent people. Lei Fang and Hana decided to target Mengyao after she ran afoul of them a few weeks ago. Other citi- zens are being rounded up in the task force’s search for Mengyao, which has caused unrest in the Lower Ring. Citizens—<i>daofei</i>, criminal, and innocent alike—are emboldened to attack guards in the streets, and the Lower Ring is at a breaking point.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rangi<span class="p">, Avatar Kyoshi’s girlfriend and personal bodyguard, was in Ba Sing Se for another matter. She sees the turmoil growing and worries that things will turn violent. As she rushes to retrieve the Avatar, she knows that someone needs to stay behind and manage the Lower Ring before the unrest causes serious issues. </span>She asks the heroes to find Mengyao and the children before things get out of hand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There is no single correct path for this adventure. This is a scenario where the characters are likely to want to visit with Mengyao first, if only to get her side of the story. But even before they do that, they may choose where to go, whom to interact with, and how to approach the situation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As they interact with the “Important Characters &amp; Groups” presented here, they may find they want to investigate different locations throughout Ba Sing Se, confront different groups, or get embroiled in a side plot while they work on their ultimate goal. The following sections give the GM the tools they need to craft a story based on the players’ choices with their characters and the actions the heroes decide to take.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Anti-Corruption Task Force</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In an attempt to curb criminal activities in the Earth Kingdom, Avatar Kyoshi created a task force dedicated to rooting out dan- gerous <i>daofei </i>gangs and dealing with violent criminals. While under her direction, the task force targeted only <i>daofei </i>who were engaged in violent criminal activities. When Avatar Kyoshi left Ba Sing Se to deal with important business, she put the task force under the direct control of the Earth King.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Since Avatar Kyoshi left, the Earth King has redirected the task force, calling it an “anti-corruption task force” dedicated to fighting all crime and corruption throughout Ba Sing Se (at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">least in theory). The Earth King has used the task force to target all criminals in the city, especially those who threaten the Earth King’s power. Captain Yong is the highest-ranking Earthbender in the task force and has taken charge of searching for Ambas- sador Quin’s children. He has decided that this is the perfect opportunity to clean house in the Lower Ring and is arresting criminals and anyone associated with them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The citizens in the Lower Ring were already disgruntled with the task force’s new approach, but the uptick in activity since the kidnapping has brought the citizenry to a boiling point. <i>Daofei</i>, common criminals, and law-abiders alike chafe under the task force’s presence. While there isn’t outright fighting in the streets yet, it’s only a matter of time.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Kidnapping</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ambassador Quin is a high-ranking Fire Nation ambassador who has been assigned to the Earth Kingdom for so long that she has a permanent residence in the Upper Ring. Initially, she was a huge proponent of Kyoshi’s task force, and even helped convince the Earth King to adopt the task force within Ba Sing Se. As the task force has increasingly fallen under the Earth King’s influence, becoming the “anti-corruption task force,” Quin has come to mistrust them. She believes the Earth King is abusing the Avatar’s goodwill and name in order to carry out a more personal vendetta against his own citizenry. It isn’t anything she would say out loud, but she is dissatisfied with Earth Kingdom politics surrounding crime, including the Earth King’s tendency to label any and all criminals, malcontents, or threats as “<i>daofei</i>.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Three days ago, Ambassador Quin’s two children, <b>Gerel and Keiko</b>, disappeared from a teahouse in the Middle Ring. The ambassador was in meetings all day, and her personal guard, Tan, had taken them out for a treat. He stepped away to deal with a minor issue, and when he returned, the children were gone. Tan found an arrow lodged in the stone wall near their table. Few witnesses saw them disappear, but those who did reported a hooded woman with a bow across her back carrying two chil- dren, one under each arm. Tan followed the trail as best he could but lost track of the culprit at the gate to the Lower Ring—a gate leading straight into the territory of known <i>daofei </i>gangs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Tan reported straight back to Ambassador Quin, who imme-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">diately alerted the Earth Kingdom anti-corruption task force of the abduction. Yong, leader of the task force, then dispatched deputies to search for the children. He also identified the arrow found at the scene as one of Mengyao’s unique arrows. He had dealings with her in the past in the Lower Ring, before she had fully turned to vigilantism, protecting the innocent. He knew her as a thief, generally not very aggressive or dangerous but more than willing to steal from those she deemed good targets, and sometimes willing to use her arrows to bring harm to guards who stood between her and her goals. It’s been some time since Yong last dealt with Mengyao, and Yong could easily convince himself that in the intervening time Mengyao has escalated all the way to kidnapping children. With Tan’s report that the <i>daofei </i>gave him the slip into the Lower Ring, all evidence seemed to point toward Mengyao.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Yong vowed to find Mengyao and arrest her, going first to her</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="p">known haunts in the Lower Ring. </span>When she was nowhere to be found, he dispatched teams of task force guards into the Lower Ring, ostensibly to hunt for Mengyao and the chil- dren, but with orders to arrest any suspicious figures, known criminals, or <span class="s133">daofei </span>they encountered. <span class="p">It has been several days, and while the task force has arrested countless individuals, Yong still has no leads on the children or Mengyao. Unwilling to sit and let Yong’s incompetence endanger her children, Quin has tasked Tan and his Firebenders to find them.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now the Earth King and his ministers are putting pressure on Yong to find the children first. The Earth King is determined to prove the Earth Kingdom can take care of its own criminals. If Tan’s Firebenders find the children first, it will be an embar- rassment to the Kingdom. The Fire Nation’s involvement is a direct insult to him and his capabilities as a ruler. The Earth</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s a <i>Daofei</i>?</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The <i>daofei </i>were first named in the novel <i>The Rise of Kyoshi </i>by F. C. Yee. The term refers to organized groups of criminals throughout the Earth Kingdom (and in some cases, beyond). It most often refers to</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">groups that have their own traditions, practices, and sophisticated codes of honor, but it isn’t always used precisely or carefully—many officers of the law refer to any and all criminals as <i>daofei</i>, even if the criminals don’t see themselves in the same way. Being <i>daofei </i>is a bit like belonging to a criminal culture; it’s exceed- ingly hard to break from these groups and you do</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">so by either violating their codes or ceasing criminal activity (possibly offending your former group). When you leave most <i>daofei </i>won’t see you as one of them anymore, but the authorities are unlikely to easily make such a fine distinction. You can read more about the <i>daofei </i>in the <span class="s59">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book on page 37.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King subtly threatened Ambassador Quin with punitive action or sanctions, but she invoked diplomatic immunity and refused to back down from the use of her own guards. This situation has put strain on the relationship between the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation, which could lead to trouble in the future. Yong’s reaction to the pressure is largely to double down on his existing strategy—he thinks eventually the task force will arrest someone who will lead them to the children—while deploying guards to monitor and hinder Tan and the Fire Nation’s soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao and Lei Fang</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About two years ago, Avatar Kyoshi arrested the Triad of the Golden Wing and scattered the <i>daofei </i>in Ba Sing Se (detailed in <i>The Rise of Kyoshi </i>and <i>The Shadow of Kyoshi </i>novels). The Avatar rounded up most of the Triad, but a few evaded capture,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">including Lei Fang and Hana. They went into hiding and slowly gathered new friends <b>to form a new gang, led by Lei Fang— the Fanged Mercenaries</b>. When Kyoshi’s task force started targeting overt criminals, Lei Fang took a mercenary route. He and his followers would work for other <i>daofei </i>groups but remain out of sight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">After Kyoshi left, the anti-corruption task force started arrest- ing any <i>daofei </i>in the Lower Ring, and Lei Fang saw an opportuni- ty. Instead of serving under different <i>daofei </i>gangs, he could target those who didn’t work with him and build an empire out of those who remained. Together with Hana, he devised <b>a plan to commit crimes across the Lower Ring and set up their rivals to take the fall</b>. They would then offer succor to whomever remained, promising to keep them safe. So far, this has worked exceedingly well, and they’ve eliminated several gangs across the Lower Ring.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao is their latest target.</p>

<b>Mengyao’s name is well-known within the Lower Ring </b>of Ba Sing Se, especially among the other <i>daofei</i>. Once she was an expert thief and archer, pulling off incredible heists, stealing from the rich, and accruing wealth. She did sometimes hurt people, though she tried to avoid doing so. Recently—after her encounters with the PCs—she turned to vigilantism, bring- ing down more dangerous criminals and <i>daofei </i>to protect the innocents of Ba Sing Se. Sometimes she steals, but she shares her ill-gotten gains with those who need them in the Lower</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ring. She’s become a bit of a legend among the <i>daofei</i>, especially because of her impressive skill in archery and her unique arrows that can cut clean through stone. <b>She has earned admiration among the citizens of the Lower Ring, and animosity among several gangs, including the Fanged Mercenaries</b>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Until recently, Mengyao had easily evaded the anti-corrup- tion task force, continuing her work—sometimes right in front of their faces. Despite the Earth King’s mandate to clear out</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">all dangerous criminals, she has a few sympathizers among the ranks of the task force, those who have turned their heads to her activities. She never worked with the task force directly, but they had a mutual understanding about the role each played</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the Lower Ring. But now with the increased pressure of the Firebenders and the Fanged Mercenaries, both Mengyao and the task force can’t ignore each other anymore.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Normally, Lei Fang’s Mercenaries wouldn’t bother with a lon- er like Mengyao. But Mengyao recognized what the Mercenaries were doing and took it upon herself to stop them. Mengyao’s attempts to foil the Fanged Mercenaries’ plans enraged Hana, and after their last encounter, Hana made sure to pluck a few arrows from the battlefield for her plan. Kidnapping Keiko and Gerel was Hana’s idea. The anti-corruption task force could not ignore such a high-profile crime, and there’s no way Mengyao could have predicted the Fanged Mercenaries would be so bold. As it stands, she still doesn’t have a clear picture that they are behind the crime.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Unrest in the Lower Ring</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se is in turmoil. Yong’s task force is intent on dealing with criminals and <i>daofei </i>and arresting Meng- yao to the exclusion of any other concerns. The task force leader has greatly overextended his reach by arresting innocent people merely for interacting with <i>daofei</i>. People in the Lower Ring now fear the task force and are refusing to cooperate. Under such cir- cumstances, people in the Lower Ring feel unsafe when they leave their homes and do not trust anyone claiming to be an authority. The people living in the Lower Ring are at a tipping point, and if the violence continues to impact their daily lives, they are likely</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to riot or worse. Driven by his goals, Yong can’t see the harm his activities are causing. Tan’s Firebenders are not actively engaged in attacking anyone, but they have argued with the task force as they get in each other’s ways while trying to investigate. Armed with Ambassador Quin’s expensive resources, the Firebenders bribe people in the Lower Ring to help them when they can, and though it’s not the Firebenders intention, the allure of bribes further alien- ates the task force from the Lower Ring citizens.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Who to Side With?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The heroes may not wish to fight the task force or the Fire- benders, preferring instead to try to join forces with one group or the other to find the children. Due to the tensions between the groups, it’s exceedingly hard for the heroes to openly work with both, but that doesn’t mean they can’t try to play both sides. Here are some things to consider if the players decide to approach one group or another for assistance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Tan feels exceedingly guilty about his role in losing Gerel and Keiko. He will do anything to get them back, even if it means working with <i>daofei</i>. He doesn’t have the same history with <i>daofei </i>as Yong and the task force, and he can be convinced that Mengyao isn’t responsible if the heroes can earn his trust.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Yong is determined to find the children, but his main focus is arresting <i>daofei </i>and other criminals. He’s willing to work with the heroes to find the children, even giving them leave to investigate on his behalf so he can focus on the <i>daofei</i>. He wants to get as many outlaws as he can while the hunt is on, and he would never work with any <i>daofei </i>to accomplish his goals. If he knows the heroes are working with Mengyao,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he will immediately turn against them as collaborators.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How It Ends</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the adventure sets up the idea that the characters need to find the children and hold out until the Avatar arrives, it’s best to let the heroes resolve the situation themselves. Avatar Kyoshi coming back to Ba Sing Se should be an epilogue to this story, one that punctuates the heroes’ success rather than having the Avatar solve their problems for them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The characters can resolve the situation in any way they’d like, but here are some suggestions on how things might end up.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Finding and returning Ambassador Quin’s children will remove the Firebenders from the Lower Ring, easing some tensions there. If the heroes are the ones to find them, then the Earth King might try to take credit, or at least use their recovery as evidence for his task force doing a good job.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The characters can clear Mengyao’s name by finding evidence that the Fanged Mercenaries are the actual culprits. Mengyao is still a target for the anti-corruption task force, but Yong would turn his attention toward the Fanged Mercenaries if he had clear evidence of wrongdoing and believed that they are a threat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If the heroes successfully take down the Fanged Mercenaries, fighting between <i>daofei </i>and guards ends, and the task force will have its hands full processing the large group. The Firebenders will find the ambassador’s children unless the heroes actively work with Yong’s group to aid the anti-corruption task force in the search.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Try to think of the ending to this adventure like the ending of an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It could end with <i>the heroes and Mengyao successfully rescuing the children and Mengyao leaping across rooftops as the task force chases after her</i>, or it could end with <i>a riot breaking out in the Lower Ring as the heroes try to get the children back home safely!</i>
