<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">History</p>
<p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From humble beginnings in the Southern Water Tribe, Iknik Blackstone Varrick used his eccentric charm, ingenuity, and busi- ness savvy to turn a single canoe into the world’s largest shipping and consumer goods empire in the Korra Era—Varrick Global Industries. The wealthy noble has never met a deal he couldn’t turn to his advantage, such as transforming his vast wealth into political influence in Republic City by funding both candidates for president. “Always hedge your bets,” as he likes to say.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Varrick is a master of recognizing unique opportunities. This was exemplified when the Northern Water Tribe occupied the South for a lack of spirituality under orders of Chief Unalaq.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seeing an opportunity for business, he took advantage of Asami Sato’s need for Future Industries funding to put in motion his plan to incite a rebellion against the North, and expand his business empire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Varrick manipulated public opinion by creating the propa- ganda movers (films) such as <i>The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South</i>. He secretly hired the Triple Threat Triad to sabotage his ships so he could both pin the attacks on the Northern Water Tribe and seize a controlling share in Future Industries. He orga- nized the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center and attempted to kidnap President Raiko, all to pin the blame on the North and pressure Republic City to become involved in the civil war on behalf of the South. And if he happened to make an extraordinary profit from all of it, all the better!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Imprisoned after his failure to kidnap Raiko, Varrick later escaped with his assistant, Zhu Li, to the Earth Kingdom city of Zaofu, seeking refuge among the Metal Clan of Suyin Beifong. Trying to turn over a new leaf, he used his brilliance to develop technologies for the benefit of the Earth Kingdom as Suyin’s Head of Technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After the Harmonic Convergence of the Korra Era, Varrick studied the spirit vines that appeared in order to harness unsta- ble Spirit Energy into batteries. However, when he learned Kuvi- ra’s intent to weaponize it for the new Earth Empire, he refused to help. After a daring escape, he teamed up with Asami to create the dragon-hummingbird mechs used to fight Kuvira’s gargantu- an war machine. And during the very same battle he confessed his love to Zhu Li. They married and when Zhu Li became the president of Republic City, he became the First Gentleman.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Play Varrick</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Do the thing! </b>Varrick is a very important man and does not have time to explain himself. He expects others to “DO THE THING!” while never explaining “the thing.”</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>You’ve got more resources than anyone, use them. </b>Be bold, direct, charismatic, a “Businessbender.” Varrick is the richest, smartest personality in the room and uses his wits to see Republic City prosper.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• <b>Never let them know what you’re truly thinking. </b>When someone gets too close to his plans, Varrick always has another up his sleeve; he is one to always “cover all his bases.”</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bring Varrick in…</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• ...when a zany plan or brilliant innovation is needed to handle a dire situation.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• ...when the companions find themselves in the middle of Republic City political intrigue.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• ...when there’s a chance to make a lot of money, for the right reasons.</p>

As long as you hold this device, you can use that technique as if it was part of your current approach by spending 1-gear. Otherwise, spend gears 1-for-1 instead of fatigue on technology techniques or basic techniques using technology training.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Varrick as a Teacher</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varrick is a genius technologist who has sometimes lacked a “moral center” (as others have told him; the terminology is a bit unfamiliar to him). He’s doing a lot better, though, trying to build a future not just to expand his own empire, not just to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">grow more powerful and wealthy, and not just to play with new science and technology. Now he’s trying to genuinely improve the lives of people around the world. That means exercising his “conscience” as best he can. But Varrick still just loves tinkering, playing with advanced technology, and playing the angles…so any PC who can appeal to his innate curiosity is likely to find</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a friendly teacher. Similarly, Varrick likes helping the little guy (especially when helping the little guy also helps him become a bigger guy), so any PC who looks like an underdog will likely earn Varrick’s interest and offers of help. As a teacher, Varrick is energized, random, and hard to pin down. He’ll bounce from topic to topic, idea to idea, and he’ll expect anyone around him to keep up. In the end, however, there’s always a method to his madness. The overall tone and style of mastery conditions Var-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rick will set to PCs is about taking incredible risks for incredible rewards. Varrick is a planner, but he also brings a strong sense</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of innovation and risk-taking to his teaching, and he wants to impart that to his students…although sometimes, he will try to temper himself with some of the lessons in restraint he has come to learn in recent years.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where to Find Varrick</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varrick is, and in some ways has always been, a Republic City man. Sure, his own company interests extend across the world. But Republic City is where the action is, the excitement, the growth, the change, the innovation! Especially now that he’s atoned for past misdeeds and is openly welcome in the city again, considering that he’s the husband of President Zhu Li Moon of the United Republic. PCs can find him in Republic City at any important hobnobbing events, as well as at the presidential residence, City Hall, interesting workshops and factories...really, all over the city.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Varrick will still travel the world and seek things out, but at this point, usually he’ll do so with very specific intent. If he wants to go out into the world to see firsthand the mining</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">location of a new important mineral—he’ll book a dirigible right away! But he’s not going to just sightsee, not when the love of his life is back home in Republic City. PCs can expect to find him at unique locations, where there’s something interesting to pursue or examine.</p>
