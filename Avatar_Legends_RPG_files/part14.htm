<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Four Nations are the stage for constantly changing conflicts, alliances, and adventures. Each era impacts the next, building on foundations laid thousands of years ago. Though the nations un- dergo many major shifts throughout history, there are locations that remain largely consistent no matter what era you play in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The lands of Avatar Legends are wondrous and diverse. They range from scorching hot to bitterly cold and the people who live in each land have adapted to their natural surroundings by either living alongside nature or overcoming its obstacles. Each Nation is geo- graphically unique and comes with its own set of natural wonders.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Water Tribes </span>primarily exist in the frigid North and South poles. Both poles are frozen landscapes where snow, sleet, and freezing temperatures are the norm. Little grows in either pole and the tribespeople hunt, forage, and trade for sustenance. Snowy mountains dot both the North and South and both tribes use the sea as a primary mode of transportation between different towns and villages. The Foggy Swamp tribespeople are an exception to their waterbending cousins, inhabiting a damp, warm swamp within the Earth Kingdom where strong spiritual energy (and water) ties them to the impressive flora in the area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Earth Kingdom </span>is the largest nation and has the most varied landscape. From scorching deserts, to frozen mountains, to rolling hills, to balmy beaches. How people in the Earth King- dom contend with its nature is dependent on the region. Larger Earth Kingdom cities are marvels of architecture and technology no matter what era you visit them in. However, many areas suffer from poor infrastructure; the Kingdom is too large—and the leaders often too corrupt—for full oversight and development of poorer regions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Fire Nation </span>is a series of islands to the west of the Earth Kingdom with numerous volcanoes. The climate ranges from pleasantly warm to scorching hot with many beautiful tropical beaches to visit on the various islands. Many of the Fire Nation volcanoes between the mountainous regions of the islands are active in every era. The warm weather suits the nation’s Fire- benders just fine and over the years inventors have developed many different ships for people to navigate between the islands.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Air Nomads </span>(or <span class="s23">Air Nation </span>in the Korra Era) are a nomadic people, but have four temples located at the edges of the map, each named after the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. Most Air Nomad temples are located in high, rocky locations that are hard to reach for anyone except Airbenders, sky bison, and other flying creatures. Though the temples are built in mountainous areas, they are far from devoid of life, with many pockets of beautiful greenery and ancient trees welcoming any number of local species.</p>
