<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 25pt;text-align: left;">your Character</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There will be times during a long campaign of play when your character undergoes massive moments of change and definition. Sometimes, they reach the end of their dramatic journey, and be- gin a whole new journey; other times, they reach the end of their current arc, and it is time for you to make a whole new character. Here’s some advice on how to deal with these different outcomes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Center Shifts Off the Edge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you lose your balance—your balance shifts off the edge of the track—then your center shifts towards that principle as well. But what happens when your center shifts off the edge of the track? It takes some time, and it’s difficult to do, but it can happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Those moments indicate that the conflict within your charac- ter about their two principles is over. They’ve made their choice, in favor of the principle their center shifted toward.</p>
<p class="s63" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p class="s63" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s63" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p class="s56" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p class="s56" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s56" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principle</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If that happens during a campaign of play, during a “season,” then treat the PC as having only one principle—that princi- ple—from that point forward. Their balance track stops at +0, and only goes up to +3 for that principle. They no longer have the other principle, and can’t be shifted toward it, tipped toward it, called upon to <span class="s11">live up to it</span>, etc.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Their center resets to +0. If they would shift their balance below</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">+0, they instead mark a condition. They can still <span class="s11">live up </span>to the one principle they retain, and they can still lose their balance toward that principle and shift center as a result.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM and player work together to go through the feature of the playbook and pick out any elements that now are resolved and don’t make any sense for the PC moving forward. For any moves specific to the playbook that call upon a principle they no longer have, the character should generally lose access to those moves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For any character who has resolved a principle like this, at the end of that campaign or season—or even earlier!—the PC must switch playbooks to something that matches their new issues, with a new set of principles.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Changing Playbooks</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a player character no longer fits a playbook—because they’ve resolved the two core principles of the playbook, or that the key ideas and conditions of the playbook no longer apply to them— then they can switch playbooks. Usually, it’s best to save this for the end of a season of play—when the story shifts significantly, al- lowing some time for a “reset.” But if it makes the most sense, then the character can change playbooks during a campaign or season.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Changing playbooks isn’t an “advance” so much as an ac- knowledgment that the PC has changed; that they are some- thing new. It isn’t useful for “resetting” to get a whole new set of advancements, but it is useful for reflecting the actual issues and problems the character faces. Don’t change playbooks idly! It signals a massive change in the nature of the character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When a PC changes playbooks, the following elements stay the same:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Stats</span>—the PC’s <span class="s52">Creativity</span>, <span class="s52">Focus</span>, <span class="s52">Harmony</span>, and <span class="s52">Passion</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Marked conditions, fatigue, and growth</span>—these simply remain, unless time has passed and they have cleared anyway.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Techniques</span>—the character retains all techniques they have, including their old playbook-specific technique, at whatever levels they have. They do not learn any new techniques, including the playbook-specific technique of the playbook they switch to.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Training, fighting style, background, demeanor, look, name</span>—all of this established material remains.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The following elements change:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Balance Principles</span>—the character takes the new principles of the new playbook and resets their center to +0. They may shift their balance one step before the start of play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Feature</span>—The character loses their old playbook’s feature and gains their new playbook’s feature. Work with the GM to determine exactly how this change fits the fiction. It is possible to agree upon some elements of the old feature that they retain, but usually they should receive all the elements of the new feature. This might require a time jump to validate certain shifts—a Bold becoming a Pillar, for example, needs time to have actually led their new squad— or a shared understanding of new truths in the fiction—an Idealist becoming a Prodigy likely discovered some new training or form of their training with which they excel, or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a Successor becoming an Icon forswears their family ties and wealth to take up the mantle of some new tradition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Moves</span>—the character retains all their current moves. They have the opportunity to swap out moves from their old playbook,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">one for one, with moves from their new playbook at this time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Advancements</span>—the PC clears any unlocked Moment of Balance advancements or center-shift advancements, freeing them up to be taken again. After you have fully migrated your character to the new playbook, then you may also choose to clear up to one advancement box each of “take a new move from your own playbook” and “take a new move from another playbook.” If you do that, you lose a corresponding move for your character. You are letting go of your beliefs, knowledge, interests, and traits from who you were under your previous playbook, giving yourself an opportunity to grow in new ways.</p>

<a name="bookmark211">Retiring a Character</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alternatively, if the story of the character is entirely over, then the player can choose to retire that character and make a new PC. Their old character goes off into the world, pursuing what- ever makes the most sense for them, but they’re no longer a main character in the story of your game of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. In order to be a main character of that story, they have to be one of the companions, traveling with the group; if they have resolved their principles and issues and now seek something new, away from the group, then this is a good option.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">“Retiring” a PC doesn’t mean they settle down somewhere, leading a quiet unassuming existence (although it might mean that, depending upon the character). It means they are no longer a PC, no longer one of the main characters of the story that you are telling together. They still exist in the world, but they’re an NPC now, if and when they show up again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The player and GM have a conversation about the “retired” character to ensure both are on the same page for what the character is doing, where they’re going, what they believe and seek. The GM should stat up them as at least a Master NPC (and quite possibly a Legend,<u> to r</u>eflect their importance to this par- ticular game) with only one remaining principle of the two they had when they retired. The GM can introduce the character into play, treating them as an NPC. The retired character can poten- tially become a teacher of new techniques, an ally in complicated situations, or even an opponent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Making a New Character</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a player retires a PC (or joins a campaign after it’s already start- ed), they should make a brand-new character! When making</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part52.htm#bookmark122" class="s25">a new character, they fill out a new playbook—different from any that the other players are using—as if starting from scratch, making choices as appropriate, filling in the blanks, and so on. See page 112</a> for more on creating a character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The only significant change is when it comes time to tie the new PC to the group. If the new character is to be introduced at the start of a campaign or season of play, integrate them as if they joined the group off-screen, between campaigns. Fill in connec- tions as normal, and establish the events that connected them to the group without playing through those events.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the new character is to be introduced during an ongoing campaign or season of play, then make sure to heavily tie that character to the purpose of the group and to at least one other player character. The new character doesn’t have to be known by every other PC and can come to grow closer to everyone with time, but they must start play with a strong reason to be part of the group, and with at least one other PC advocating for their place in the group. Do not play through the discovery of who</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is the new player character’s advocate—instead, establish that when making the character by establishing a strong connection (familial, friendship, training, etc.) between them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Center Shifts as Character Arcs</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Losing your balance and shifting your center is a hugely important part of your character’s immediate story, but it’s worth looking at your center as a kind of long-term measure of your character’s overall arc as well. Each time you shift your center toward one of your principles, your track grows a little shorter—it’s easier to lose your bal- ance toward that principle again in the future! As you tilt one direction, toward one principle, you can start to see where your character might end up.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part84.htm#bookmark204" class="s28">If you like that direction for your character, it’s okay to lean into it and push toward one of those principles. In the end, you’ll change playbooks and find a new chapter of your character’s story or retire the character complete- ly. But it’s also okay to use your balance shift advance- ments (page </a>210) to push your character away from the edge, giving yourself more time to play out the tension inherent in your playbook’s principles.</p>
