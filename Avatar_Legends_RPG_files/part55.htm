<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every character in <span class="s11">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>can use basic moves, each of which move the game’s story forward. There are seven of them: <span class="s11">assess a situation</span>, <span class="s11">guide and comfort</span>, <span class="s11">intimidate</span>, <span class="s11">plead</span>, <span class="s11">push your luck</span>, <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training</span>, and <span class="s11">trick</span>. The move to <span class="s11">help another companion </span>is also explained here. This section covers how each of the moves work in more detail with in-game examples.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Looking for a way to escape the path of a rampaging boar-q-pine, scouting ahead for danger in a mysterious cave, sizing up your oppo- sition in a heated negotiation—any time you try to gather specific or useful information during a tense moment, you make the <span class="s11">assess a situation </span>move. If you’re simply taking in a scene or looking for surface details about a situation, you don’t trigger this move just yet. The GM tells you everything you could want to know at the surface level—even if they tell you, “From a quick glance, you’re not sure, you can’t tell.” Once you start scrutinizing a situation in more detail, look for specific information, or want to find answers to any of the questions listed under this move, then you’re <span class="s11">assessing a situation</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Crucially, the GM always answers the questions fully and hon-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">estly. When you ask, <i>“Who or what is the biggest threat?” </i>their answer <i>is </i>the biggest threat. If someone new shows up or the situation changes, then the answer might change, but at the moment that you ask the question, you can know the answer is complete and true.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whatever answers you get, you take +1 ongoing when acting on that information. This means as long as you take action based on those answers, you add +1 to all moves you make. If the situ- ation changes significantly—like if a new, bigger threat appears or you find your way out of the situation—then this bonus no longer applies. It’s possible to act on multiple answers at once, in which case you stack the +1 ongoing bonus, as long as you don’t exceed the limit of +4 to a roll (including your stats).</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Assessing a Situation</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What here can I use to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>?” <span class="p">is the question to ask if you’re looking for something specific to accomplish a goal, whether it’s an item or environmental feature. If you’re being chased by gangsters through busy city streets, you might ask the GM, “What here can I use to slow them down?” You can fill in the</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">blank with anything you like, but sometimes the answer might be “nothing,” in which case you have to think on your feet or try a different tactic.</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Who or what is the biggest threat<span class="p">?” tells you who or what is the most dangerous person or thing in the situation. You can specify if you’re most concerned with threats to yourself or to others. The GM then tells you which of the multiple hostile NPCs is the most dangerous to you and your companions, which of the various hazards in an environment is the most important to avoid, or just who is the nastiest, most intimidating person in the room.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<i>“What should I be on the lookout for?” </i>lets you know what dangers or complications hide here, foreshadowing problems before they arise; you might find signs of something dangerous on the horizon or notice a hazard just before it appears. If you’re <span class="s11">assessing a situ- ation </span>while exploring the Foggy Swamp and ask this question, the GM might say you notice a wild cat-gator lying in wait. If you ask this question in a tense village after dark, you might notice everyone has charms nailed to their homes to ward off dark spirits.</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“What’s my best way out/in/through?” <span class="p">helps you figure out a way to get into or out of somewhere. When you ask this ques- tion, decide which of the three options you’re focusing on—out, in, or through. A way out helps you escape the situation, a way in helps get you </span>into <span class="p">danger, and a way through helps you bypass obstacles or impediments.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Who or what is in the greatest danger?” <span class="p">might sound similar to “Who or what is the biggest threat?” but it’s about finding vulner- abilities in your surroundings, not dangers to yourself. When you ask this question, you’re focusing on the people </span>affected <span class="p">by threats, rather than identifying the threats themselves. This can give you insight into impending perils or the plans of an antagonistic NPC.</span>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Haki the Successor has been thrown into a cell by the Earth Kingdom soldiers! Hector, Haki’s player, says, “I’m wandering around the cell, examining everything. I need to find a way out! Can I <b>assess the situation</b>?” The GM agrees, and Hector rolls, getting an 11. <i>“What’s my best way out?” </i>asks Hector.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“You can’t really firebend your way out of here—the cell’s too small, you might just roast yourself,” says the GM. “But you can try to land pinpoint strikes on the cell’s bars—they’re crumbling, and if you apply your chi-blocking techniques just right, you might be able to knock them out. What’s your other question?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Hector thinks for a moment, and then says, “<i>What should I be on the lookout for? </i>What’s going to get in the way of my escape?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, yeah, well there’s guards in this place, but you think you can handle them—the big problem is the water traps you spy in the ceiling. They’re barrels of water that can be dropped with a bit of earthbending, and they’ll douse fires in a moment—clearly, this prison has handled Firebenders before. So, what do you do?”</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Are you <b>assessing the situation</b>?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Well, not originally, but…yeah, that makes sense.” Nadja rolls and gets a 9. “I want to know <i>what can I use here to impress Wing</i>?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Interesting!” says the GM. “You spy Wing out on the dance floor, enjoying herself. The dance is formal, but you can tell Wing has a flair for the dramatic—she keeps dipping and twirling her partner. Maybe you can impress her with a dance?”</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Offering life advice to a friend as you brew them a cup of tea, reaching out to someone in pain to show them they’re not alone, teaching a peer self-control through a bending exercise—any time you try to comfort, offer guidance, or steer someone’s course of action through wisdom, not persuasion, you’re <span class="s11">guiding and com- forting </span>someone. This move allows you to help others clear their conditions and fatigue, while also learning about their current feelings…as long as they open up to you. The person you’re trying to <span class="s11">guide and comfort </span>might not want to hear any advice and push you away instead! That stings, but you still make them think, even if they don’t accept your words or offers of comfort.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">In order to trigger this move, you need to <i>honestly </i>offer com-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fort or guidance to someone else. If you’re deceiving someone by being nice, you’re <span class="s11">tricking </span>them, not <span class="s11">guiding and comforting </span>them. If you’re desperately trying to get them to act in a certain way for your sake, then you’re probably <span class="s11">pleading</span>. If you’re push- ing them to act in accordance with their own values, you’re <span class="s11">call- ing them out </span>with their principle. When you <span class="s13">guide and comfort</span>, you’re being genuine and showing the other person you care about them and how they feel. You might be offering wisdom or advice, but you’re not getting them to do something right this second—you’re just trying to guide them to a better place, to a better balance. Asking someone if they’re all right is a start but you need to offer guidance or comfort to trigger the move (even if you don’t know exactly what’s on their mind when you do).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The most obvious time to <span class="s11">guide and comfort </span>someone is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">when sharing a quiet moment, like while making camp or after a tense situation, but it’s not the only time you can reach out! You might try to <span class="s11">guide and comfort </span>an NPC after trading blows in a combat exchange, for example. Maybe you’re confronted by a fellow sword fighting student who blames you for failing to protect your shared master’s life. You can see the anger and guilt in their eyes as you parry their wild swings, so you sheathe your sword and say, “I know you’re in pain; I am too. But killing me won’t bring Master Yeong back. We all tried to save her; now we</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">need to work together to honor her memory.” The GM describes your classmate fighting back tears as they quaveringly point their sword at you; to find out if your words get through to them, the GM says you’re <span class="s11">guiding and comforting</span>!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Guiding and Comforting</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The most important part of <span class="s11">guiding and comforting </span>someone is that your target needs to either accept you reaching out or shut you down. If you <span class="s11">guide and comfort </span>another PC, they need to do more</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">than just say, “I embrace your guidance and comfort”—they need to show everyone <i>how </i>they do that! This looks different depending on the situation. If you offer a hug and words of reassurance, maybe the other person falls into your arms and sobs out their true feelings. If you show someone how they could improve one of their weakness- es, they might shut you down and blow up in your face about how you’re always telling them they’re not good enough!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they embrace your guidance and comfort,” </i>your target choos- es to immediately clear one of their marked conditions <i>or </i>clear</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2-fatigue. Your offer of comfort helps calm them down or helps them find the strength to press on, depending on the situation. On a 10+, you can also shift their balance however you want. Your words deeply affect them in this moment and get them to consider things in a new light. In both cases, you can ask one question—any one question—and they must answer honestly. The question is generally best phrased in the fiction, something your character asks their character, but it can include awareness that goes slightly beyond the fiction; their “honesty” can take the form of telling glances or body language. You do not have to ask a question if you don’t want to ask one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they shut you down,” </i>your target immediately inflicts a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">condition on you instead—it hurts when you try to help and the other person shuts you out! After they inflict a condition on you, you shift their balance. They might not open up to you but your words still stick with them, reinforcing an already-strong belief, pushing them back from the brink, or helping them find some kind of balance.</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, I think so—I’m reshaping her idea of how to get jus- tice, but I’m also supporting it, so I say shift it up,” says Lex.</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Shihan the Pillar has sought out a distraught Teru Jinno after Teru was berated by his parents, successfully finding him up on a rooftop overlooking Republic City. “I want to <b>guide and com- fort </b>Teru—I approach and put one hand on his shoulder and say, ‘They don’t have to define you, you know. You pick who you want to be,’” says Shihan’s player, Seiji.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Yeah, that sounds like trying to <b>guide and comfort</b>. Roll for it!” Seiji rolls and gets an 8.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">“Okay, Teru, do you open up to Shihan?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“No,” says Tyrelle. “I’m Angry, so I’m lashing out at a friend to clear it. ‘What do you know about it?! You’re just a pro-bender, and you don’t even know who your parents are!’”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Goodness,” says the GM. “All right, so that means Shihan, you mark a condition, but you also get to shift Teru’s balance.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“I’m still shifting it toward Progress,” says Seiji. “I think my words at least partially got through. And I’m marking Troubled.”</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hold, +1 Forward, &amp; +1 Ongoing</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Some moves refer to hold, taking +1 forward, and taking +1 ongoing as outcomes—these are bonus- es! <b>Hold </b>is a temporary resource connected to the move you got it from—when you receive it, you “hold” onto it until you spend it as outlined by that move. If a move tells you to “hold 3,” for example, you gain three points to spend on that move’s options and effects. Moves with hold often tell you how to spend it, like “one-for-one,” meaning you can spend one point of hold on one of the move’s possible effects. Since you’re “holding” onto it, you don’t need to spend all of your hold at once! You might spend hold right away on an effect or save it for later in a scene.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Hold usually has to be spent in the course of the conversation or scene in which you gain it, unless the move specifies how and when the hold expires. If you’re unsure if your hold is still available, ask the GM for clarification. If you have hold from multiple sources, they don’t pool together and you can’t spend it between two moves’ options. To keep track of any hold, you might use a die, tokens, or coins, or just make hatch marks on your playbook—but most of the time, you spend it fast enough that you don’t have to keep close track.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a move tells you to <b>take +1 forward</b>, you gain</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">+1 on your next roll that applies. These effects often state “take +1 forward to/when <u>&nbsp; </u>,” meaning the bonus is added to the action or condition listed.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Once you’ve used the bonus, it’s gone. Since a +1 forward applies to the <i>next </i>roll you make that fits the conditions, you can’t hang onto it for later— it’s not hold! When a move tells you to <b>take +1</b>
</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<b>ongoing </b>instead, that bonus applies to <i>all </i>applicable rolls as described by the move. Moves that give +1 ongoing tell you how long the bonus lasts for, but if need be, the GM is the final arbiter of when the bo- nus ceases to apply—usually when much time has passed or the situation has substantially changed.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they attack you, but off-balance,” </i>they lash out (and likely trigger a combat exchange) but they’re struck by your words in some way—the GM also marks an appropriate condition on them. This reflects you getting under their skin, which gives you a slight advantage as the interaction comes to blows.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Demanding surrender from a <i>daofei </i>society leader at spearpoint after taking out their minions, using your family’s dangerous reputation to pressure a smuggler into giving you a stolen item, threatening a bouncer to let you into an exclusive gambling house—any time you threaten an NPC into retreat or surrender with words or fists, you are <span class="s11">intimidating </span>them. You might <span class="s11">intim- idate an NPC </span>with physical threats and harsh words but you can just as easily intimidate them with displays of power, blackmail, or other more subtle tactics. As long as you’re trying to scare them off or pressuring them to give up/in, you make the move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you roll a hit to <span class="s11">intimidate</span>, your target (not you) chooses one of the four options based on their goals and the fiction. If you roll a 10+, you limit the NPC’s actions by removing one option before they choose, pushing them further in the direc- tion you want. If you want to force an NPC to surrender without fleeing, remove their option to <i>“run to escape or get backup.” </i>If you don’t care if they flee but you don’t want to come to blows (again), say they can’t <i>“attack you off-balance.”</i>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that you can only target NPCs with this move—if you want to push your companions to do (or not do) something, you need to try a different tactic (like <span class="s11">calling them out</span>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a hit to <span class="s11">intimidate an NPC</span>, remember that the GM chooses how your target responds. This depends on their goals, feelings (and marked conditions), and the fiction of the game, but they might just give you what you want even if you don’t roll a 10+.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they run to escape or get backup,” </i>they immediately try to flee the scene. If you want to stop the NPC, you need to try something fast or even drop into a combat exchange to keep them here. Once they leave, they either stay gone if they’re try- ing to escape or alert others and escalate the situation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they back down but keep watch,” </i>they give in to you for now but they’re still on their guard. They won’t make a move against you just yet but if you give them a reason or push them further, the situation gets worse. Hostile NPCs give you leeway but with hands on their weapons, while others keep a stern eye on any potential troublemaking.</p>

Quinn, Quartz’s player, describes Quartz stomping up to the guards. “I’m getting close and telling them I’m an undercover Fire Nation operative—I’m doing my best to look all impressive and cow them into letting me through. Is that an <b>intimidate</b>?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“No, I don’t think so,” says the GM. “It’s more of a <b>trick</b>—it depends upon them believing you’re an undercover Fire Nation operative, right?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Ah, I get it,” says Quinn. “Okay, well, I still want to say that, but it’s pure pretense—I don’t care if they buy it or not. I just stand there, glaring at them, flexing my muscles, picking at scars.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The GM considers—in another situation, it might not be quite enough to be intimidating just to stare and flex, but here, these are only regular guards. “Perfect, that’s an <b>intimidate</b>. Roll!”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quinn rolls and gets a 12! “I kind of want to say that they can’t run and get backup…but I think I’m more worried about them attacking me and slowing me down, so I pick that. They can’t attack me.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Great!” says the GM. “They look at each other, and it’s clear they both don’t want a fight. ‘Ah, yes, uh, sir,’ says one. ‘Feel free to make your way inside.’ As soon as you do, you look behind and you see they’ve run off, presumably to go get help. What do you do?”</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Teru Jinno the Successor has just been apprehended by Republic City’s police force. He’s wrapped up in metal wire as they’re carting him off. “One officer sneers at you,” says the GM. “‘Any- thing to say for yourself?’ she asks.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“I look back up at her and sneer right back,” says Tyrelle, Teru’s player. “‘Yeah,’ I say. ‘Wait until my mother hears about this.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Aiko Jinno isn’t known to be kind to those who interfere with her plans…or her family.’”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Is that an <b>intimidate</b>? Invoking the name of your great and terrible mother?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Oh for sure,” says Tyrelle, and he rolls. He gets a 7.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM considers what the guards will do—the GM could pick any option off the list, but in this case they think it’d be better if the guards just give in. “Well, immediately as soon as they hear your mother’s name, the officers all share a glance, and then they begin to rapidly unwind you from the metal wire. ‘Apologies, sir,’ says one through gritted teeth. ‘We had no idea who you were. Please give the Lady Jinno our best wishes.’ They clearly are angry with you, Teru, but there’s no way they want to cross Aiko Jinno.”</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Begging a friendly innkeeper to hide you from the Fire Nation soldiers pursuing you, asking a grateful prisoner you’ve just freed to stay and help instead of escaping, asking a mentor to teach you a bending technique they don’t think you’re ready to learn—any time you try to get help or a favor from an NPC, you are <span class="s11">pleading with an NPC</span>. This move is for more than just calling in a favor or asking for them to back you up. If you ask an NPC for something small (especially something that doesn’t cost them anything), or request help that they’re already willing to give, you don’t trigger this move. If they’re reluctant to assist, the request could cost them or put them in danger, or other things at play might cause them to resist, then you need to <span class="s11">plead </span>with them to get their help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The other important thing about triggering this move is that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the NPC needs to care what you think. If you try to convince an utterly hostile NPC, an NPC who doesn’t take you serious- ly, or an NPC whose life and wellbeing isn’t affected by you in any significant way, you can’t <span class="s11">plead </span>with them. To get an NPC to care about what you think, you need to have an established relationship or do something to make a good impression—you might be their mentor or family member or demonstrate your competence through action or by helping them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In general, this move covers persuasion that isn’t rooted in wisdom or philosophy, and instead focuses on immediate action. If you’re trying to guide someone to (or away from) balance, then you’re <span class="s11">guiding and comforting </span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark141" class="s25">them (page 128);</a> if you’re trying to get them to act in a specific way right now, you’re <span class="s11">plead- ing </span>with them.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a hit to <span class="s11">plead </span>with an NPC, they’ll do or give you what you ask for, but they may need a little push before spring- ing into action. On a 7–9, they need reassurance or something extra before helping. An NPC might agree to help you travel through a dangerous area but only if you bring them some supplies they lack for the journey. Another NPC might agree to teach you a dangerous combat technique on the condition you can prove you’ll use it responsibly first. Either way, they won’t commit to helping you until you give them what they need first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a 10+, however, they don’t need any reassurances—they do what you ask right away to the best of their abilities. Re- member, if the situation changes, their response might change as well! If things become dangerous or don’t work out, they may revoke that support. If you <span class="s11">plead </span>with a village elder to change an old tradition and you get a 10+, you might convince them to try it for now but they’ll go back on the agreement if it goes badly for any reason.</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Well, I’m not sure they care what you think,” says the GM. “But I’m the last of the Chitin Warriors!” says Bei. “I climb</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">on top of the back of my stag-beetle when I say all this. They should care because I’m a legendary warrior! I’m the Icon!”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Fair enough,” says the GM. The GM also thinks it’s fine here to treat the whole group as a single NPC—at this moment, the whole group functionally has the same drive and principle.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Bei rolls to <b>plead </b>and gets a 7. “The townsfolk look at you, standing on the stag, then at each other, then back at you. Then one of them says, ‘Maybe we have a chance with the Chitin War- rior leading us.’ A bunch of others echo that sentiment, and soon the whole crowd is revving itself up. They’re ready to fight the Fire Nation, but only if you’re right at the front, leading them.”</p>

I did do him that favor before, when the New Equalists attacked.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The GM nods in agreement—Iris did help Dai, and he does care what she thinks—and Izzy rolls. She gets a 10! “Dai looks around, and then says, ‘All right, come on, now. Just keep your heads low and stay quiet so you don’t get me in trouble.’”</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Swimming through rapids after a pirate ship, convincing some- one you weren’t stealing from them after being caught red-hand- ed, leaping to catch a priceless artifact before it shatters on the floor while your hands and feet are bound—any time you rely on fate and luck to carry you through instead of skills or train- ing, you’re <span class="s11">pushing your luck</span>. If you’re attempting something complicated or risky outside the scope of your training (bend- ing, weapons, or technology), or one of your backgrounds, you trigger this move.

<a href="part55.htm#bookmark142" class="s25">(page 133)</a> to do the same thing.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">doesn’t neatly translate to any of the other basic moves. If the outcome of your dangerous action is uncertain or you’re relying on fortune itself to carry you through a risky action, you need</p>

<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In some cases, you might try to do something simply beyond both your skills and training, or you might be hoping for a lucky break. The GM may either say you outright can’t do that given the circumstances or just tell you what happens when you try.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Options for Pushing Your Luck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you roll a hit to <span class="s11">push your luck</span>, you always pay a cost for your audacity. The exact cost of succeeding by the skin of your teeth is the GM’s call, and it depends on the situation. The most common cost is marking one or more fatigue or a condition (mostly for physical actions), but costs can include anything: using up supplies, shifting your balance, or more abstract costs. You might claw your way out of a quick-flowing river but ruin your rations or lose a personal item in the water. You might survive a tense social situation with your lies intact, but lose the trust of an involved NPC or expose others to danger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite the cost, <span class="s11">pushing your luck </span>can pay off in the form of an unforeseen opportunity when you roll a 10+. This oppor- tunity is either caused by your boldness or you noticing some- thing in the process of <span class="s11">pushing your luck</span>. As such, it’s usually a time-sensitive opening that must be capitalized on quickly (by you or your companions). The GM describes the opportunity. Remember that getting the opportunity never means that you avoid paying the cost inherent in the move—you <i>always </i>pay a cost when you <span class="s11">push your luck</span>!</p>

She’s currently locked in a tower overlooking the sea below, awaiting the return of the local tyrannical Earth King- dom governor, who will not look fondly upon her. “Okay…but I have a window, right?” asks Kayla, Kirilaq’s player. The GM nods.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Then…I dive out the window to the sea below! They didn’t know I was a Waterbender when they locked me in here, did they? Yeah, it’ll be perfect! I’ll just waterbend the sea to catch me! So that’s <b>rely on my skills and training</b>, right?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Hold on,” says the GM. “You are very, very, <i>very </i>high. Sure, you can try this—your waterbending abilities give you the slimmest of chances. But it’s definitely <b>pushing your luck</b>, not <b>relying on your skills and training</b>.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Kayla decides to do it anyway, and rolls. She gets an 11! “Okay, so the cost you pay is that this still hurts a bunch, like getting punched in your whole body at once as you hit the water. Mark 3-fatigue. But the opportunity—as you fall, you see a boat out there. You’re certain it’s not flying Earth Kingdom colors, but you’re not certain of much else. If you want, you can use your momentum to bend yourself in an arc through the water and fly up onto the deck of the ship. That’ll only cost 1-fatigue more.</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ren Tsuji the Prodigy has wound up in the cockpit of a hum- mingbird mecha suit, trying to flee from a squadron of biplanes flown by Triad members! “I gun it!” shouts Ruhan, Ren’s player.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Hold up,” says the GM. “No way you know how to fly this thing. You’re a master martial artist, the greatest archer in the world and deadly with any weapon invented…but you’re not at all trained in Technology, are you?” Ruhan shakes their head. “That’s what I thought. This is <b>pushing your luck</b>, my friend.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ruhan rolls and gets a 9. “Excellent,” says the GM. “So you blast through the air, doing your best to make this thing fly and dodge at the same time—and it works! But not before the mech takes a few hits from the biplanes’ new lightning guns. You</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">pull away from the other biplanes, which turn back to the city as you hurtle into the mountains…where you are DEFINITELY going to crash.”</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using wilderness survival skills to pacify an angry armadillo-bear, invoking courtly etiquette to blend into a Fire Nation noble’s party, creating handholds in a stone wall to infiltrate a compound—any time you use your expertise and knowledge to overcome a signifi- cant complication or risk, you’re <span class="s11">relying on your skills and training</span>. When you try to do something risky that isn’t covered by any of the other moves and involves your training, one of your backgrounds, or other skills, you use this move. Like <span class="s11">pushing your luck</span>, this catch- all move covers a lot of things but requires more specificity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To know whether or not you can <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training</span>, you need to know <i>what </i>your skills and training are. At the start of the game, the clearest indicators of these are your training (bending, weapons, technology) and your backgrounds. If your character used to work at City Hall in Republic City (using the Urban and Privileged backgrounds), it stands to reason that you can <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>to play politics and navigate bureaucracy, know your way around the city, and fit into high society. If you’re an Airbender, you might <span class="s11">rely on your airbending </span>to cushion your fall</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">off a rooftop, deflect incoming projectiles with a burst of wind, or even—with enough training—sense danger by air vibrations alone. Your playbook can also point to things that you can <span class="s11">rely </span>on, like the Icon’s <span class="s23">Burden &amp; Tradition </span>or the Successor’s <span class="s23">A Tainted Past</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s important is to make note of what these skills and training are as they come up, and to keep in mind what’s outside your areas of expertise. As you play, you’ll gain more skills and learn about what things your character can do with their train- ing. Your character might eventually gain mastery over a wide array of skills and talents but at the start of the game, there’s only so much you can <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>to do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The actual effects of this move cover a lot of ground, as well. First, you can try to overcome obstacles. Most commonly this means physical obstacles, like barriers or hazards, but it can mean social obstacles as well. Your firebending can help you blast the door into ashes, but your upbringing as a servant in the high court of the Fire Nation can help you get into the servants’ quarters of the local manor without any suspicion. You can even “overcome an obstacle” to quickly dispatch low-threat foes, if appropriate—clocking two clueless guards on the back of the head might knock them out with a single <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>move, bypassing combat altogether. “Overcome obsta- cles” is a fairly open-ended idea that almost always means, “solve a problem with your training or skills.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">You can also try to gain new insights. When you <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>to do so, you’re using your expertise or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">specific abilities to look for more specific information than what you might find just by examining a scene or even <span class="s11">assessing a situation</span>. You might use your training to improve or extend your senses—like earthbending to locate a hidden attacker through seismic sense—or give you specialized insights that others with- out your skills might miss, like a Technologist figuring out how to shut down an experimental device gone haywire.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where’s the Bending Move?</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There is no one “bending” move—bending (or an action using non-bending training) happens with a move, not because of it. Moves instead focus on your character’s intent. In game terms, whether you sling a rock near a guard to get them to leave</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">their post or use airbending to throw your voice and taunt them away, you’re <b>tricking </b>them. You might <b>guide and comfort </b>someone by saying kind things to them, or you might create a gentle fire that warms the two of you as you huddle in the night air. If you use bending in some way that doesn’t match up easily with any of the other moves, it’s most likely <b>relying on your skills and training</b>, but even then you might end up <b>pushing your luck </b>if it’s particularly risky or uncertain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Your background also determines what kinds of informa- tion you can obtain—an Outlaw PC can identify and decipher thieves’ signature graffiti, a Monastic PC can identify the signif- icance of religious iconography, and so on. Whenever you want to learn something beyond the scope of <span class="s11">assessing a situation</span>, you can <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>if it’s in your wheelhouse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, you can try to perform a familiar custom. This aspect of <span class="s11">relying on your skills and training </span>is most often about social ac- tions (like fitting in somewhere) but it also covers specific rites, rituals, and practices based on your training or background. A Privileged PC from a noble family can try to infiltrate an illicit auction by knowing the right things to say, while another PC with a reclusive Monastic background might need to <span class="s11">push their luck </span>to blend in. A PC with the Wilderness background from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Southern Water Tribe could <span class="s11">rely on their skills and training </span>to undertake the ice-dodging rite of passage, steering their boat through danger to prove they’ve come of age. If you’re attempt- ing to bypass an obstacle or navigate a situation that you’ve experienced before as part of your background or training, it’s probably a familiar custom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Because this move covers so many different things, it can be tempting to use it for everything, so make sure you’re not trig- gering a different move instead. Generally, if any other move fits better, use that one. If you’re generally looking over a besieged area to see what’s useful, what’s in danger, and so on, you’re <span class="s11">assessing a situation </span>even if you have a background as a siege engineer. But if you use that Military background as a siege engi- neer to specifically locate structural weak points for demolition (gaining new insight), you’re <span class="s11">relying on your skills and training </span>rather than <span class="s11">assessing a situation</span>. The GM makes the final call on which move is appropriate.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s24">Options for Relying on Your Skills &amp; Training </span>Unlike when you <span class="s11">push your luck</span>, the consequences for rolling a 7–9 (and even a miss) on this move aren’t as harsh. You have more control over your approach because of your experience, and you’re capable of dealing with complications as they arise. On a 7–9,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you accomplish your goal but not quite in the way you wanted or intended—the GM tells you how your action <i>might </i>lead to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unexpected consequences. This information is for you, the player, so you can decide if you want to let this happen or not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to accept those consequences, your character might know what’s coming or they could be totally caught off- guard. By choosing to mark fatigue instead, your character sees that complication as or just before it happens and manages to straighten themselves out before it makes things worse. When you mark fatigue, describe how you compensate for your less- than-perfect attempt or otherwise push through.</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quartz the Guardian wants to warn the local Earth Kingdom military forces about an impending Fire Nation ambush, but Quartz has a Military background—he knows that it’s not going to be the easiest thing in the world to reach the right ears. “Can I use my knowledge of the military to find someone at the right rank and position who’d listen to me, and who can actually do something with that advice?” asks Quinn.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Sure,” the GM says. “But first you have to find the officer; you’ll have to figure out a way to persuade them once you’ve found them. Roll to <b>rely on your skills and training.</b>”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Quinn nods and rolls, getting a 9. “So I think that this means you’re going to be noticed as you go around the camp,” says the GM. “You are drawing the attention of people in the military camp who think you’re suspicious—they won’t intervene before you talk to someone, but they might make it tough to get out of here. Unless you mark fatigue to avoid notice.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oof, I don’t have much fatigue to mark,” says Quinn. “I’ll just let them spy me.”</p>

Because this is your jam—archery—and the train is stationary, and you’re not in any dire condition right now, just standing firmly on a</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">rooftop, let’s just make it a <b>rely on your skills and training.</b>”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ruhan rolls and gets an 8. “I think this is about how much control you have over exactly what you hit with your arrow— whether you just smash the controls so no one can even start the train, or whether you break the controls so no one can oper- ate them, but wind up locking them into full throttle.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, man, I definitely don’t want to make this into a rocket train. I mark the fatigue,” says Ruhan.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Faking illness to draw a guard into your prison cell, dressing up as a dark spirit to scare intruders away, convincing a ship captain to give you passage with forged papers—any time you use your wits and skills to fool, confuse, or deceive NPCs, you’re <span class="s11">tricking an NPC</span>. This move covers all sorts of deception, from bald-faced lies to creating diversions. Whether you’re bluffing your way into or out of somewhere, fooling or distracting someone, or otherwise convincing an NPC of a falsehood for some reason, it’s a <span class="s11">trick</span>. If you just lie without any intent to push the NPC to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">action, though, you’re not <span class="s11">tricking</span>. And if you lie in a particularly ridiculous, completely incredible way—the NPC has to be a fool to fall for it—then you’re probably <span class="s11">pushing your luck</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When you trigger this move, first tell the GM what you’re trying to get the NPC to do. If you’re not trying to get them to do something right this second, then you’re not <span class="s11">tricking </span>them yet. On a hit, they take the bait and do what you want, but only for a short while. You then get to choose <i>how </i>they fall for your trickery—they might be briefly thrown off or flustered, make a mistake you can capitalize on, or buy it hook, line, and sinker. A roll of 7–9 lets you choose one of these options, while a particu- larly effective trick on a 10+ lets you choose two instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Missing on a <span class="s11">trick </span>attempt can result in a lot of different results. The most obvious outcome is that your target catches you in your lie or discovers your deception. They might just as easily go along with it but reveal a new complication about the situation in the process. They might even believe your trickery in a way that brings too much attention to you—not only do you convince the opera house staff that you’re filling in for a sick performer, but they tell you you’re about to miss your cue and shove you on stage!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Options for Tricking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they stumble,” </i>the NPC believes your deception and it catches them off guard. When you next make a move against them based on your trickery, you take +1 to the roll. If you don’t choose this option, they buy your trick but you can’t continue to use it as leverage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they act foolishly,” </i>they fall for your trick in a way that also creates another opening for you to take advantage of. They might reveal something hidden, falsely assume something else that benefits you, or otherwise give you a chance to act. Whatever it is, it’s only a momentary opening and you still need to act quick- ly to seize it. If you don’t choose this option, your trick grants the original opportunity without any extra openings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“they overcommit,” </i>not only do they take the bait but you sell it so well that it takes a long time for them to realize they’ve been fleeced. If you don’t choose this option, your trick deceives them but they catch on sooner rather than later to your trickery.</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Excellent,” says the GM. “So they’re really into this, enjoying beating you—but of course, only by the skin of their teeth, you make sure, to keep the tension—and they start openly talking about all manner of things, including the crates and how they think dragon eggs are inside, and where exactly the eggs are going to be stored. They even imply the lock is special, how no one can get in without a special tool, and one guard shows you a weird flute in his tunic.”</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Nokahhak the Bold wants to save her friends from being cap- tured by some Triad toughs! “I rush out toward them, shrieking and screaming and looking behind me,” says Nadja. “‘SPIRIT! SPIRIT ON THE LOOSE! RUN! RUUUN!’ I want them to bolt!”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Hm,” says the GM. “That seems a little unlikely to fool them—yeah, there are spirits around Republic City now, but one random stranger yelling isn’t that convincing. I’d say you’re <b>pushing your luck </b>right now.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Can I make some subtle airbending motions, create a whis- tling, groaning wind that blasts out from the alley to help sell it?” asks Nadja.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">“Oh, absolutely, that’s perfect. Roll to <b>trick these NPCs</b>!”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Nadja rolls and gets a 7. “I just want them to stumble—that way, if they do figure out what’s up, I’ll get a +1 forward against them,” says Nadja.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Excellent,” says the GM. “So the Triad toughs start running away from the weird wind pouring out of the alley, and that gives you and your friends a chance to flee in the other direction!”</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you take appropriate action to <b>help a companion</b>, mark 1-fatigue to give them a +1 to their roll (after the roll). You cannot help in a combat exchange in this way.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Airbending wind into the sails as your companion steers your ship through jagged rocks, splitting up to look for clues in an abandoned temple, putting on a dramatic performance to help sell your companion’s con—any time you step in and assist another PC’s actions, you are <span class="s11">helping a companion</span>. This can help them succeed by either improving their roll from a 6 (a miss) to a 7, or a 9 to 10!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In order to <span class="s11">help a companion</span>, you must provide assistance somehow, and you must mark fatigue. It’s not enough to say, “I’m helping” and mark fatigue—you need to explain how you’re helping your companion succeed! If they’re repairing a sabotaged Satomobile mid-race, for example, yelling advice at them from across the crowded racetrack isn’t going to cut it. If you can’t think of a way to help or you can’t mark fatigue, your character is either out of ideas at the moment or tapped out and can’t <span class="s11">help </span>another PC.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">As mentioned before, <span class="s11">helping a companion </span>can only increase their roll by 1. If your help doesn’t bring your companion up</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a range of success (i.e. <span class="s11">helping </span>on a roll of 6 or 9), there’s no need to <span class="s11">help</span>—it won’t change the outcome of their move. You also can’t <span class="s11">help </span>more than once for the same ally’s move, even if you have the fatigue to burn. However, you can still count on the rest of your companions—multiple allies can <span class="s11">help </span>with the same move! To do so, everyone providing aid to that PC’s roll must describe how they assist in the moment and must spend 1-fatigue each.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can <span class="s11">help a companion </span>on most moves <i>except </i>the <span class="s11">stance move </span>in combat exchanges. (For more on the <span class="s11">stance move</span>
<a href="part59.htm#bookmark151" class="s25">, see page 148.)</a> This is because the speed and chaos of combat emphasizes your individual actions. When fights break out, it’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">assumed that you are generally doing the best you can to defend yourself and others involved. Instead of <span class="s11">helping </span>on individual approaches themselves, you can still use techniques like Ready or Bolster to apply useful status effects to your allies or the environ- ment, and you can coordinate your strategy in each exchange.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Lukta the Idealist, played by Lex, is trying to <b>plead </b>with Uhakka, a Northern Water Tribe ship captain, to stop Uhakka and her crew of Waterbenders from launching a tsunami at a nearby village with a Fire Nation production facility.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Please, there are innocent people in that village. They don&#39;t de- serve what you&#39;re about to do to them—you&#39;re going to take their homes away, the way the Fire Nation has taken away the homes of so many,&quot; says Lex, speaking directly as Lukta. The GM nods, and Lex rolls with <span class="s52">Harmony </span>and gets a 6 total—a miss!</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;I want to help!&quot; says Hector, the player of Haki the Successor. &quot;I can mark fatigue to make that a 7, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;You can, if you can do something to actually help,&quot; says the GM. &quot;What do you do or say?&quot;</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">&quot;I say, &#39;I&#39;m from the Fire Nation, and my family has done a lot of harm to innocent people—I know what it costs. Don&#39;t become like them!&#39;&quot; says Hector.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Hm…I don&#39;t think that works. Uhakka has a lot of anger towards the Fire Nation, so identifying as a Fire Nation citizen isn&#39;t going to help get her to listen,&quot; says the GM.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Can I help?&quot; asks Kayla, the player of Kirilaq the Rogue. &quot;I&#39;m from the Southern Water Tribe, maybe he&#39;ll listen to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;You might have been able to help, but aren&#39;t you already trying to waterbend the giant wave away, even as they raise it? You&#39;re a bit busy, so you probably can&#39;t help now, not without losing concentration on what you&#39;re doing,&quot; says the GM. &quot;So it stands as a miss, and here&#39;s what happens next…&quot;</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Iris the Adamant, played by Izzy, rolls to <b>rely on her skills and training </b>to try to earthbend a massive chunk of dirt and stone to flip it on top of the nearby charging mecha suit. Izzy rolls and gets a total of a 9—a hit, but it will still cost Iris something.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Can I help?&quot; asks Seiji, the player of Shihan the Pillar and another Earthbender.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 4pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">&quot;Sure!&quot; says the GM. &quot;What do you actually do?&quot; &quot;Hm. Iris and I bend pretty differently, but I use my style to make the earth flow like water in a big</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">circle, creating a ditch so it&#39;s easier for Iris to lift the whole chunk of earth,&quot; says Seiji.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Cool! Mark 1-fatigue. That&#39;ll give Iris a +1 and make that roll a 10!&quot; says the GM.</p>
