<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions get a weird sense of déjà vu when an Earth- bender with a hood approaches them, asking to talk in private... Then it hits them! They’ve seen her on a wanted poster for stealing from Sparrowkeet Air, a corporation that develops and builds flying contraptions! The poster got her name right, Qian Yu, but she explains that the rest of the poster is false—she isn’t a master thief, but an archaeologist. She discovered a lost Air Nomad artifact from the Eastern Air Temple, which dates back to right before the Hundred Year War, but then she fled when she learned Sparrowkeet Air’s true motivation: to sell these items to the richest bidder!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Qian Yu believes this valuable piece of history belongs to the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">whole world—or at least, the last surviving Airbender—and she wants the companions’ help escaping Sparrowkeet Air’s clutches to deliver the artifact to Toph’s Metalbending Academy instead. As someone who trained with Toph for a time, Qian Yu knows the legendary bender can get this artifact to the right people!</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using This Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This adventure creates a sandbox for your PCs where they can un- ravel a diplomatic intrigue that could shape the history of the world. Some of the tools available to you are found in these sections:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Summary” provides an outline of the adventure and explains the various issues the players face.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Introduction” brings the PCs into the story and sets up your group to undertake the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Characters &amp; Groups” provides information on NPCs the companions might meet as they flee toward the Beifong Metalbending Academy outside Yu Dao.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Locations” features different areas for the PCs to explore during the adventure and explains where important characters might be found.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “GM Advice” contains additional guidance for this adventure just for the GM and gives advice on how the adventure could end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Pregenerated Characters” is a set of five premade characters your players can use to hop right into the adventure. We also include a hook that ties the characters to the adventure.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">No Path to the End?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are used to running adventures with heavily detailed encounters and prepared NPCs, it might come as a surprise that few mechanics are written into this adventure, beyond the esca- lations and some information about various characters. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>relies on players triggering moves based on the actions they take during play instead of asking players to make any specific checks for specific actions required by the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since every significant action a PC takes drives the action of the game forward, <b>there is no prescribed order of events</b>. Instead, the adventure puts the PCs in a dramatic starting situ-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ation that demands immediate action from the heroes! It’s your job to use the material in this adventure to keep things moving, providing interesting events and NPCs to consistently engage your players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about running <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game </span>in the core book, <b>Chapter 8: Running the Game</b>, and more about how moves shape play in <b>Chapter 3: Funda- mentals of Play</b>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s10">Using the Pregenerated Characters </span>There are five pregenerated characters included at the end of this adventure. Each character has a unique history, playbook, and set of stats. Your players can use these characters to play through this adventure, or they can create their own as explained in the <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The pregenerated characters have their moves, feature ele- ments, and techniques already chosen; players need only decide whether to shift their balance by one step at the start of play, and which principle to shift it toward. Players can adjust the pregen- erated characters to make themselves more comfortable, altering names, look, and even mechanical elements like the stat boosted by the free +1 at character creation if they are familiar enough to make that choice. The characters are designed to work well with the current elements included and the adventure as presented, but as always, if the GM and player agree then they can make changes as desired. After selecting the pregenerated characters, players will still go through the process of filling out connections with each other.</p>
