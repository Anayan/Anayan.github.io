<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Republic City has grown substantially in only a matter of decades, making it one of the most important economic and cul- tural hubs in the world. The city started off as Cranefish Town</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the Earth Kingdom and became a metropolis as more people desired to live in a multicultural environment. Now, Republic City hosts the pro-bending championship, companies like Cab- bage Corp and Future Industries, inventors, industrialists, and Air Temple Island, which serves as a home for Tenzin’s family as well as a haven of Air Nomad culture.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part39.htm#bookmark97" class="s25">Republic City is also home to a new spirit portal. Kuvira created the portal by accident when she lost control of a spirit energy cannon (page 81).</a> This portal became the source of much conflict in the city, with spirits and humans fighting over the territory. Wonyong Keum, the CEO of Keum Enterprises, wanted to build an amusement park around the portal, complete with guided tours into the Spirit World, and went so far as to hire the Triple Threat Triad to secure the area. After that plan backfired and led to the Triple Threats turning against him, he eventually signed a contract giving the lands to the Air Nomads who now protect the portal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The newly elected president of the United Republic of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nations is Zhu Li Moon. President Moon won the election after working tirelessly to help the people living in the temporary evacuee camp after the Earth Empire invasion. As for law en- forcement, the United Republic of Nations has its own military, the United Forces, and a police force with an elite squad of Earthbenders, all trained in metalbending and equipped with metal wire reels and metal armor.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zhu Li Moon</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The hardworking President of the United Republic of Nations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zhu Li, the current president of the United Republic of Nations, recently won the election over former president Raiko. She is a selfless, compassionate, and considerate leader who genuinely cares about the well-being of the people of the United Republic of Nations. During Kuvira’s uprising, Zhu Li joined the Avatar in the fight against the Earth Empire and personally tried to sabotage the spirit energy cannon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part40.htm#bookmark99" class="s25">Recently, Zhu Li married her former boss, Varrick (page 84),</a> a successful businessman with flexible morals. Because Zhu Li prioritizes the citizens she governs over all else, she sometimes forgets to take care of herself. Heroes who help pre- serve Zhu Li’s precious time and energy by taking on Republic City’s problems themselves are sure to win the president’s good will. If there seems to be more depth to an issue in the city than meets the eye, chances are heroes can find the beginnings of an answer from Zhu Li.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asami Sato</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The bold and brilliant CEO of Future Industries</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part39.htm#bookmark96" class="s25">Asami Sato runs Future Industries, a company based in Republic City that creates cutting-edge technology, vehicles, and industri- al equipment. The company, founded by Hiroshi Sato, Asami’s father, was passed on to Asami when he was apprehended as a co-leader of the Equalist movement (page 80).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Asami has been friends with Korra since she first came to Republic City, and the two officially started a romantic relation- ship after defeating Kuvira. Those who target Asami’s loved ones better know what they’re doing, as Asami is a skilled engineer, strategist, and martial artist. She’s also clever enough to put her extensive connections and resources to good use. Heroes in need of advanced technology or vehicles might turn to Asami for help. Non-benders in particular could find her a useful ally, since she has numerous tricks up her sleeve for facing a master bender.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lin Beifong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Republic City’s fierce and headstrong Chief of Police</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part42.htm#bookmark100" class="s25">Lin Beifong is the Chief of Police in Republic City and the daughter of the legendary Toph Beifong (page 86).</a> Like the other officers in her metalbending police force, she uses</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">metalbending to apprehend criminals and wreck large metal structures, including vehicles, when necessary. Rough around the edges and abrasive, Lin generally chooses to do things by the book with little flexibility.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">She also has a strong moral compass. Lin devotes herself to keeping innocent people safe and aiding the Avatar during the times when their moral compasses align…and sometimes even when they don’t. She is a strong ally and a terrifying enemy due to her relentless personality. Heroes contending with criminal activity might turn to Lin for help or advice. Otherwise, Lin might ask heroes to work for her undercover in order to learn about a triad’s or an extremist group’s inner workings.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spirit Energy</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Given the world’s burgeoning power demands, some inventors now look to spirit energy as a possible solution. The potential for this new energy source seems near-limitless. With new technologies and urbanization on the rise, this energy source could be just what the nations need to push them into the future.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part39.htm#bookmark97" class="s28">However, this is an increasingly controversial topic thanks in part to Kuvira’s creation of a destructive super weapon (page </a>81). Many people, such as Avatar Korra, are wary of spirit energy and be- lieve spirit-based energy is a non-starter, not only</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">because of the destruction it can cause, but also for how it could potentially harm humans’ relationship with the spirits even more.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bolin</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A skilled Earthbender who can bend lava</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bolin grew up with his older brother Mako on the streets of Republic City after their parents were killed by a Firebender. They made their own way, and became pro-bending athletes, the Fire Ferrets, with Avatar Korra later joining their team. Bolin is an impressive Earthbender who later learned to bend lava. He’s goofy, kind, and rarely seen without his loyal companion, a fire ferret named Pabu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After his time as a pro-bender, Bolin starred in movers (moving picture films) for a time before a stint working as an officer in Kuvira’s military. When Bolin realized Kuvira’s nefarious inten- tions for the Earth Kingdom, he broke free from her influence and aided the Avatar in defeating Kuvira’s giant mecha. Recently, he decided to pursue a career in politics, and now works as President Moon’s assistant.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mako</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A skilled Firebender and Republic City detective</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the older brother, Mako has always felt a heavy sense of dutiful responsibility. When the boys were young, he did ev- erything in his power to protect Bolin. This led to Mako having a sternness and no-nonsense attitude, which he’s softened over the years through caring for the people he loves. Today, he’s thoughtful, pensive, and able to bend fire and lightning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Firebender dated both Asami Sato and Avatar Korra; while the two women are now in a relationship with one anoth- er, Mako still loves and supports both of them as friends. Mako’s innate warmth and willingess to do what it takes to protect the people he loves has made him an integral part of the Avatar’s entourage. Through the years, Mako has worked his way up from being a beat cop to a detective in Republic City’s police force.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Republic City Spirit Portal</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Industrialization vs. Tradition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Republic City spirit portal is a source of constant conflict and its location in the middle of a big city draws a lot of atten- tion. President Zhu Li Moon withdrew the United Forces from the area when she won the election with the goal of promoting peace and cooperation instead of fear. Should conflict between spirits and humans escalate again, however, this spirit portal likely sits at the center of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Surrounded by tangled spirit vines, the portal once led to a meadow of flowers, though the spirits have razed the area just inside the portal to discourage meddling humans from crossing over into the Spirit World. Those wishing to enter the Spirit World may try to use this portal since it is more easily accessible than the frigid wilderness of the North and South Poles where the two other portals are located. But to do so, they’ll have to contend with members of the Air Nation, who protect the area.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Triads</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several triads operate within Republic City, and some of these criminal organizations have large numbers and powerful con- nections. Government officials and corporations have a history of hiring the triads to do their dirty work. Some of the most well-known triads in the city include the Triple Threats and the Creeping Crystal Triad.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Being part of a triad is dangerous work, as members have both law enforcement and other triads to worry about. Much of the time there is also the threat of backstabbing within the ranks of any triad as well. Anyone involved with a triad needs to be prepared for a lot of deceit, betrayal, and in-fighting. Heroes who make an enemy out of a triad find Republic City exponentially more dangerous.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remaining Red Lotus Supporters</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Extremism Born of Fear</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Korra and her allies defeated the known core of the Red Lotus, but it is impossible to know how many supporters are still out there and whether they may be planning another attack on the Avatar. Without any clear leaders, ambitious plans usually re- main just that—plans, and nothing more. Zaheer still lives, and while breaking him out of prison would be incredibly difficult, the prison’s defenses may not stop his followers from trying.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that the three other leaders are dead, members of the Red Lotus looking to climb to a place of power and authority may see this as a perfect opportunity. An aspiring leader struggling to gain acceptance in the Red Lotus might even launch a reckless attack against the Avatar or her supporters in order to prove they are right for the job.</p>

<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Korra Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though both Water Tribes were at war only years ago, relations between the two are now relatively calm. The tribes were all but officially separate for years, but now each works to define who they are with true independence. Both the North and South maintain lines of communication with one another, ever</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">careful not to slip into old patterns from when they were united. The twins Desna and Eska currently lead the Northern Water Tribe, having taken up governing the tribe after their father was defeated by Korra, and Tonraq (Avatar Korra’s father) leads the Southern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska, though exceedingly dour in nature, do not intend to make the same mistakes as their father, and they focus the North on making healthy connections with the outside world. As tradition states, the North must always care for the spirits, but in this modern age more is needed. While the leaders are loath to admit it, and thus show it in their actions instead, the North can no longer stand on its own in an era of increased international cooperation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Water Tribe is the largest it’s ever been, having seen a much-needed population boom since the end of the Hundred Year War. Relations between the tribes are aided by the relationship between their leaders; Desna and Eska are Tonraq’s nephew and niece, and while they fought against their uncle during the civil war, all three now enjoy a more peaceful relationship. The Southern Tribe’s ability to adapt and overcome offered them many boons in the modern era. International ven- tures of Southern Tribe businesspeople see widespread success across the world and foster a boom in industry and an expansion of their wares across the globe.</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Avatar’s parents and the caretakers of the Southern Water Tribe <a href="part39.htm#bookmark96" class="s25">Tonraq and Senna are Avatar Korra’s parents, and Tonraq has been the official Chief of the Southern Water Tribe since the tribe gained its independence. The civil war was hard on the couple for many reasons, one of them being that Unalaq (page </a>
<span class="p">80), Tonraq’s brother, violently attacked Tonraq and tried to kill his daughter. Being the parents of the Avatar isn’t easy, and Korra even turned against her father at one time, believing he</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">didn’t trust her to make wise decisions in regards to her training.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Senna, by far the calmest and most composed of the three family members, sometimes must act as a grounding force for the other two. When a brewing problem appears in the Southern Water Tribe, Tonraq and Senna are often some of the first to know about it. Heroes who discover something afoot in the tribe might want to bring the information to them so they can prepare for what’s coming.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kya</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A master Waterbender, healer, and warrior</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kya is Aang and Katara’s daughter, and, like her mother, she is a skilled Waterbender and healer who has traveled extensively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kya lives in the Southern Water Tribe but goes where she is needed. Most recently, she traveled to Republic City after Kuvi- ra’s uprising to help in the evacuee camps. When disaster strikes, she can quickly switch between healing the injured and taking on attackers without missing a beat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a queer woman, Kya is particularly supportive of Korra and Asami’s relationship. She has a nurturing streak as well as a bit of a snarky one, but she never lets a grudge or hurt feelings stand between her and protecting her family. Kya is also ex- tremely perceptive and uses that skill to her advantage, when not distracted by one of her siblings. She does have some lingering pain, though, from her father favoring Tenzin, the Airbender, over his other children.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Twin leaders of the Northern Water Tribe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desna and Eska are the twin waterbending leaders of the North- ern Water Tribe who took over after their father’s corruption and defeat. The two are practically inseparable and share similar affectations—namely, a constant air of mild disdain. Though they remained loyal to their father almost until his demise, the twins do not hold any ill will towards Korra for her conflict with their father, as they recognize that he was no longer the father they knew when their battle took place.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Eska and Desna spend their time governing the Northern Water Tribe, and anyone who wants to get on the good side of one must get on the good side of both, but the twins have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">little tolerance for insincere sycophants. Heroes who want their respect are best served by being honest and direct with them, though they still may get drolly mocked in return.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varrick</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An absurdly wealthy businessman who excels at getting into and out of trouble</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Iknik Blackstone Varrick grew up poor in the Southern Water</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part42.htm#bookmark101" class="s25">Tribe, and went on to become an extraordinarily wealthy busi- nessman, making some truly bad decisions along the way. He was partly responsible for the Water Tribe civil war, escalating the conflict by orchestrating the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center and blaming the attack on the North, but the businessman escaped without suffering the full consequenc- es of his actions. He took part in stoking another war by aiding Kuvira (page 87)</a> in creating the technology to harvest power from spirit vines. However, upon realizing that Kuvira planned to use these vines as a weapon, Varrick worked together with Korra to stop the would-be dictator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">

He certainly has enough money to assist in the most outlandish of endeavors so long as someone can sell him on the idea.</p>
