<a href="part21.htm#bookmark64" class="s25">In this era, the 55 Earth Kingdom states have become increasingly isolationist. In the previous era, Avatar Kyoshi (page 32)</a>
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25"> helped shape various bureaucratic policies in order to aid the poorest of the kingdom and strengthen ties between states. These policies carried through to this era and were embraced by the Earth Sages. After seeing their order embarrassed and diminished in past years, the sages sought redemption by getting the states to work with one another, embracing their role as wise advisors and academics. This laid the groundwork for the sages regaining much of the trust they lost. They even dared speak out against the Earth King when they felt his actions became too brazen. Then, in one night, the Earth Sage order was eliminated (page 46).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Ever since the order’s destruction, the current Earth King</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">has manipulated the constitution, set up by Kyoshi and the 46<span class="s48">th </span>Earth King, into a bloated piece of legislation, which only the rich know how to exploit. Earth King Jialun is a cruel man who cares very little for his people and very much about maintain- ing power. He is willing to take extreme measures to ensure his uncontested rule and foments xenophobic hate for other nations and internal squabbling to avoid losing power—thus the peas- ants have something to hate other than him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Thanks to Jialun’s greed, people in the kingdom suffer. Mean- while, governors of the various states rule near-autonomously; even the most noble governors face an uphill battle combatting the corruption their more nefarious counterparts gleefully em- brace. There’s little in the form of broad technological advance- ment in the Earth Kingdom at this time, not because there aren’t scholars working on it, but because any new technology is seized by the crown and gifted out to vassals as the Earth King sees fit.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earth King Jialun</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The corrupt Earth King looking to stay in power by any means necessary</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Jialun is a petty, calculating man continuously underestimat-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">ed because of the bureaucratic nature of the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To outsiders he’s a ruler trapped in the binds of an ineffective system which fails to empower people, but Jialun knows he’s the spider spinning the web. After he did away with the sages, he manipulated the system to his benefit and the incompetence he portrays is entirely by design. He keeps his people subjugated and ruthlessly removes any opposition to his rule, all from an ap- pearance of weakness. Internationally, he manipulates others to keep the people in the Earth Kingdom focused on threats from outside rather than within.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Jialun is likely to contact heroes if they have something he wants or something he can exploit. If they cause enough trouble, they’re likely to encounter the Dai Li first, and Jialun second only if they cannot be contained. The Earth King is never one</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to overplay his hand and always approaches as a friend first to entrap a person in his schemes.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guo Xun</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The benevolent queen of Omashu who works to undermine Jialun’s rule <span class="p">Guo Xun is the graceful and elderly queen of Omashu. As a child, she idolized Kyoshi, who supported Guo Xun’s family tak- ing the throne with the sacred duty to protect Omashu. When she became queen, she wholeheartedly embraced the political structure the Avatar helped create. She despises Jialun, finding most of his actions cheap and selfish; only someone insecure</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in their power needs to weaken the standing of those who have nothing to begin with. So, she works as a balancing force to Jial- un’s machinations, embroiling her city and its diplomats in just enough conflict to not spark an all-out war with Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Guo Xun is likely to contact heroes if they’re notably op- posed to Jialun’s schemes in the Earth Kingdom. She might ask them to spy for her or smuggle technologies for her scholars undetected in the Earth Kingdom. She’s a brilliant political strat- egist and can help sharpen the keenest minds.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sud</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The earthbending master who taught the Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sud is a middle-aged earthbending master with a blunt and straightforward attitude. The Earthbender is famed throughout the kingdom for his honesty and grit. There’s no stronger believ- er in the Earth Kingdom and what it represents than Sud, who is convinced Earth Kingdom citizens can hammer out the issues with their great nation and see a brighter future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Earthbender was recently summoned to instruct Earth King Jialun in advanced earthbending techniques, after Sud’s success with teaching Roku. Through the months Sud’s spent at the palace he’s noticed Jialun is not so ignorant as he pretends to be. Sud’s worried the king has nefarious plans for the kingdom, but the earthbending master is in over his head when it comes to politics. He may need a hero’s help to unravel the schemes the Earth King has put in place.</p>

<a name="bookmark80">Grand Lector Willow</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A former Earth Sage working to preserve knowledge of her extinct order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">When the Earth Sage order was abolished, Willow received two</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">choices—evolve or disappear forever. Rather than perish with her order, she accepted a new position teaching in the rebranded</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Royal Learning Halls and vowed to never speak of her order again. Those who still fondly remember the sages see the flighty lector Willow as a traitor, someone who betrayed her colleagues for a prestigious new position, but Willow is not entirely as she seems.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Within the soft-spoken lector burns a fire of rebellion. She is furious about what happened to her fellow sages and the knowledge they worked to protect. From her position in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Royal Learning Halls, she works to preserve ancient Earth Sage knowledge for a time when her destroyed order may be resur- rected. Currently, she’s in search of allies who can help her do this, to smuggle ancient scrolls to safe locations and perhaps to uncover what happened to her missing colleagues.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ban Buhai</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A spy who poses as a lowly fish merchant</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buhai is an unremarkable fish merchant who often takes his stock to sell in Ba Sing Se…but really, Buhai is a spy for the Earth King who uses his fishing business as an excuse to be away for long periods of time spying on the Northern Water Tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He’s extremely good at his job and even the name Buhai is an alias—to those who know the truth of him, he’s only referred to as Echo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The spy’s current mission is to discover a way to destabilize the Water Tribes’ alliance with one another. The Earth King believes that if he can get the North to act unilaterally without an agreement with the South, it would drive a wedge between the tribes. To that end, Buhai gathers intel on the North’s chief to exploit at a later time.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Langzi</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A notorious outlaw folk hero looking to stamp out corruption</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Langzi is a wandering outlaw with a penchant for doling out justice. People say they’re a master warrior who can wield almost any weapon. No one knows who they are or what they look like, as they always keep their face covered in a mask, but their focus is on taking down corrupt politicians who exploit the common folk. They’re currently at the top of the Dai Li’s most wanted list.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In truth, Langzi was a swordsmith named Junyi who fell in love with one of his clients. The two men were set to run away together when his lover’s wife, who was mayor of the town, discovered the affair. She had her husband killed and pinned the crime on Junyi, manipulating the system so he had no way to prove his innocence. Since then, Junyi has been on the run, posing as a lowly beggar in various towns to uncover corrupt people in power and bring them to justice under the identity of Langzi. Junyi never seeks out allies, but could potentially work with people who align with his goals.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25">Natsuo Island lies just between the Fire Nation and Earth King- dom just off the coast of Crescent Island. Because of its proxim- ity to both nations, both governments never laid claim to it… until now, following the discovery of a large cache of ore on the island. Sozin claims the island is part of the Fire Nation and that the citizens of the Fire Nation need the island after the Crescent Island disaster (page 46).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Earth King knows Sozin’s posturing serves his nation’s growing industry, not his people, and isn’t willing to let the Fire Nation have the island without opposition. If Jialun goads Sozin into making the first move towards aggression, even better. To that end he’s sent a few military vessels on training exercises just off the island’s coast and waits to see Sozin’s next move.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se vs. Omashu</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Propaganda and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Omashu and Ba Sing Se have often vied for prominence within the Earth Kingdom and this era is no different. Guo Xun, the queen of Omashu, hates the Earth King and does everything in her power to undermine his influence short of starting an all-out war. Both monarchs have numerous spies in each other’s courts and both throne rooms are vipers’ nests.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Recently, the delivery system in Omashu, long chutes weaving through the city navigated with earthbending, has been acting up. Lines are crumbling and wares fly from the chutes and injure citizens. Guo Xun is sure this is Jialun’s sabotage and she’s looking for a way to prove it. She needs the saboteur caught and enough</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evidence to utterly humiliate Jialun next time she visits Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Floods in the South</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Connection vs. Isolation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The south of the Earth Kingdom faces a number of floods, which have devastated small towns and infrastructure. Rather than sending aid to these remote villages, the Earth King has sent troops offering the citizens affected by these floods a home in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se’s Lower Ring in return for work fortifying the Outer Wall. With some towns experiencing a near-leveling of their infrastructure, many consider it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In contrast, some accepted the aid from the Air Nomads of the Southern Air Temple. Though the Air Nomads of the south have been hesitant to overstep their bounds in Earth Kingdom land, they’re more than willing to help when natural disaster strikes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some Earth Kingdom citizens question if it is wise to reject the king’s generous offer in lieu of asking the Air Nomads’ help, but surely the king is too magnanimous to truly take offense.</p>
