<a name="bookmark302">&zwnj;</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These locations are scattered around different parts of Republic City. In general, moving between locations causes the GM to tick another segment on the clock, but otherwise travel through the city isn’t especially difficult or complicated. Remember that the locations are all in different neighborhoods of the city; the surrounding areas are quite distinct from each other!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Pro-Bending Arena and Presidential Box</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Pro-Bending Arena is a gem of the city and the place to be during bending match days. Many residents will take time from their day to catch a few of the matches and get some needed R &amp; R. Many particularly powerful or wealthy guests have private boxes—newly installed after Amon’s attacks on the stadium.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varrick disappeared from the Presidential Box, and the adven- ture starts in that Presidential Box.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sho Lin is the primary source of clues in the box. She knows more than she’s letting on and might tip the PCs off to elements of her suspicions—for example, it’s suspicious that this hap- pened just before Varrick was scheduled to speak to the Utilities Commission on behalf of his friend Wakkanai, and the most likely figures with the ability to abduct the First Gentleman are powerful elites of the city such as the mysterious businessman San Ho. She’ll grow tight-lipped after letting slip any particular names or information, however. Varrick’s security detail is no longer here to answer other questions.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs find the small storage room where Varrick was abducted. He lost a small stone dragon necklace in the scuffle, and the PCs find it tossed beneath a set of shelves. The necklace is stamped on the bottom with Everything but the Dragon!, pointing to a curio shop in Dragon Flats. The necklace was worn by a member of the Triad who stole it from the store and subsequently lost in the struggle with Varrick.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• In the same storage room, the PCs find the pieces of a torn and crumpled note—the missive Varrick received inviting him to the meeting. Terra Triad goons tore up the note. The note, when reassembled as much as possible, reads something like: “Varrick—Here in town. Meet in storage room of Arena. Know what you did to me. Time to settle old differences. Don’t bring Wakkanai—Yinuo.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• In the Presidential Box, the PCs find a ticket to the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center’s opening exhibit for Water Women of Republic City. This new exhibit has been advertised throughout the city for the past few months. The ticket was given to Varrick by Wakkanai, and it slipped out of his pocket as he left the box.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Dragon Flats Borough</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dragon Flats is one of the poorer neighborhoods in Republic City and a locations where, normally, many of the triads com- pete over territory, allegiances, and new recruits. The neighbor- hood is packed tight with streets and alleys, shops and restau- rants (like the infamous Everything But The Dragon! curio shop), and many people going about their lives. Most of those residents keep to themselves, only really acknowledging locals they know well. The place looks a bit dilapidated—the money for repairs being squeezed out by the Terra Triad—and clearly bears the signs and iconography of the Terra Triad all around; the competition over Dragon Flats seems to have been resolved, at least for now.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asking locals questions about the Triad doesn’t reveal much easily—they don’t want to talk and put themselves or their loved ones in danger—but if the PCs can convince the locals to share information, they’ll learn that a whole group of Terra Triad members departed in a pair of Satomobiles earlier today. Fur- thermore, Lin Li, proprietress of Everything but the Dragon!,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is happy to talk about the Terra Triad; their leader, Steely Ning; and their real boss, San Ho. Lin knows there was a Terra Triad plot involving Varrick, and she tried to warn him—and she also knows where the PCs might go to learn more: the Ba Mi Tang.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• All around the borough, the PCs spot posters announcing the new Water Women of Republic City exhibit at the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. Every one of these posters was vandalized with hateful messages from the Terra Triad. Posters about other things were left untouched.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs’ attention is drawn to a full bucket of Ba Mi Tang dumplings sitting on a bench, uneaten. Every resident of the neighborhood walks by the bucket as if purposefully not seeing it. The bucket hides a secret communiqué informing someone in Dragon Flats to watch the Terra Triad for any signs of a stolen cache of explosives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A group of obviously marked Terra Triad members move around the borough, flexing, intimidating locals, and shaking people down for “rent.” If confronted, they have legal documentation for operation as rent</p>
<p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">collectors on behalf of the San Ho Consortium. Following them eventually leads the PCs to Warehouse 26.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An architectural gem and newly completed building at the southern edge of the city, the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center was designed by Southern Water Tribe architects and bears a distinctive, beautiful style combining modern materials with glass shaped like traditional ice structures. The Center hasn’t been in the city for very long, but it is continually adding and building and growing, especially with the support of power- ful individuals like Varrick, Avatar Korra, and Wakkanai. Inside, visitors can learn all about the history of the Southern Water Tribe, its culture, and its important legacy in the development of Republic City.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A massive plaque thanking Wakkanai for donations to help found the center, including quotes of praise from Varrick, helps connect the two figures. Inside, some city officials and report- ers are gathered for a dedication of a new exhibit honoring the “Water Women of Republic City,” including Wakkanai. Kiaanii, Wakkanai’s daughter, is present at the dedication. Kiaanii can describe her mother’s issues with the treatment facility and the threat that San Ho poses. She will also indicate that she believes San Ho is connected to the Terra Triad through some odd business links she discovered. She reminds the PCs that they might be able to find Wakkanai at the water treatment facility or chatting with some of the Utilities Commissioners at their offices at City Hall.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The portion of the new exhibit devoted to Wakkanai explains the water treatment plant and how vital it is for all of Republic City. Those exhibits include subtle, quiet mentions of Wakkanai’s “partner”—carefully censored references to Yinuo’s contribution. There’s enough there to make clear that someone has been cut out of the history. Any archive of records (like that at the offices of the <i>Republic News</i>) could help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Part of the center honors Varrick himself, as well as his contributions in developing the water treatment facility. Wáahlaal, the reporter, is either looking at the exhibit, or is already with the PCs. She is happy to explain the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rumors about Varrick’s shady dealings in those days. She’d also be happy to exchange information with the PCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• San Ho himself is here at the opening of the exhibit in disguise! He moves through the museum quietly, wielding his anonymity subtly…but he stands out to the PCs as a well-dressed, older Earth Kingdom</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gentleman whom no one can identify. He will notice the PCs tracing him and will then depart quickly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Following him leads the PCs to Warehouse 26.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Offices of the <i>Republic News</i>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you want the <i>real </i>info about Republic City, then the <i>Republic News </i>is the newspaper you want. The offices of the <i>Republic News </i>are set inside a larger building, and they’re full of paper, ink, mess, and lots of little spirits hang out in the office perching on filing cabinets, fluttering in the wind of electric fans, and gen- erally enjoying the vibrant energy of this hectic place. The offices have an archive of old papers in the basement, but finding any information without the guidance of someone who knows the files is almost certainly a time-consuming and difficult task.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Wáahlaal isn’t with the PCs—whether because they haven’t found her yet or because they lost her—she’ll be here. She is always willing to trade information about San Ho, Wakkanai, the water treatment facility, Varrick, the Utilities Commission, and some of the criminal dealings throughout the city. She has a picture of Wakkanai and Yinuo from back when they were first partnering on the technology for the water treatment facility,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and a whole folder’s worth of articles tracking the two of them as Wakkanai rose and Yinuo fell. She can call out suspicious odd- ities in Yinuo’s discrediting. In particular, she notes that things took a significant turn against Yinuo after Varrick got involved, and some reporting from the time suggested that Varrick and Yinuo never saw eye to eye.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Wáahlaal discovers that a crucial piece of evidence, something that actually might implicate San Ho with the Terra Triad, is missing—just as an unidentified person starts fleeing through the offices! The thief is a Terra Triad member sent by Steely Ning to disrupt the investigations. Tracking the thief leads the PCs straight to Warehouse 26.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Putting together sightings, interviews, and maps leads the PCs to recognize that the Terra Triad’s presence in Dragon Flats is centered on certain buildings— including the apartment building where Terra Triad lieutenant Wei Tia lives. If they go investigate the building, they can speak to Wei Tia openly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Interviews with Commissioner Chao of the Utilities Commission, speaking about Varrick, Wakkanai, and San Ho, indicate that Chao was totally ambivalent for a time…until suddenly, she was vehemently against Wakkanai retaining the rights to the water treatment facility. Strange behavior—worth investigating.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Water Treatment Plant and Catacombs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Located near the center of the old city, the water treatment plant has been a fixture of the area for as long as anyone can remem- ber. It is the source of fresh water for the extensive plumbing throughout the city. The plant provides clean water for each and every resident of the city. Beneath the plant are the catacombs, where all the pipes connect into a central location. There is also a mural rife with Southern Water Tribe symbology, depicting the Water Tribe bringing fresh water from deep underground (the aquifer) to help create a thriving Republic City. Images of Water Tribe women in a joyous celebration surround the reservoir.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wakkanai is here, trying to fix up the facility, overseeing repairs and clean-up for the upcoming inspection. She seems stressed, but she still warmly greets the PCs. If they give her any inkling of what’s really going on, she’ll gladly tell them everything she knows, and she will be genuinely concerned about her friend Varrick if she hears that he is missing. She can even explain aspects of her history with Yinuo. Also, as they move around the plant and the catacombs beneath it, the PCs may encounter signs that some of the staff have been replaced with Terra Triad members preparing to plant the bombs there later tonight!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• The PCs discover a room with Terra Triad members setting the first group of explosives for the bombing tonight! Defeated Triad members and the tools</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and equipment they were using point back to San Ho Consortium and Warehouse 26.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Exploring Wakkanai’s offices, the PCs find an old photo from the <i>Republic News </i>of Varrick, Wakkanai, and Yinuo. If they have already seen San Ho, they recognize him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Otherwise, they can investigate at the <i>Republic News </i>offices.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Investigating the places where things have broken down recently shows subtle yet unmistakable signs of tampering—signs that Wakkanai missed in her stress and busy schedule. Wakkanai immediately suspects</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commissioner Chao knows more than she’s letting on, as Chao mentioned the problems with surprising specificity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ba Mi Tang Dumpling Headquarters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Mi Tang serves hopelessly mediocre dumplings…but the customers aren’t always there for the cuisine. Rather it is a location for “business” in the criminal underworld of Republic City. Information flows in and out of Ba Mi Tang like the wa- tered-down soup they serve. Of course, obtaining such informa- tion usually requires a certain degree of money, circumspection, and careful verbal jousting. The place is packed with people of all kinds and a constant cacophony.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All throughout the Ba Mi Tang Dumpling Headquarters are Terra Triad goons, watching everyone. Wei Tia himself can be found here, and Steely Ning might make an appearance. Lots of rumors and secrets are flying around, and while the Terra Triad can’t possibly keep a lid on the exchange of information, they can certainly try to slow the flow of information to ensure no one learns what they’re up to in time. Trading useful information here with any of the myriad vendors, gamblers, and con artists can reveal a whole bunch of rumors about the Triad, including how they’ve been bankrolled by the San Ho Consortium, how they recently pulled some kind of job at the Pro-Bending Arena, or how they have been collecting explosive material.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Pearl tries to sell water-resistant explosive priming and ignition equipment, supplies left over from what she sold to the Terra Triad. The equipment points</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at a place where a water-resistant bomb would be most important—the water treatment facility.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Obei, a cook and information trader, will straight-up tell the PCs that San Ho has bribed Commissioner Chao of the Utilities Commission in the hopes that it messes up San Ho’s plans—San Ho and the Terra Triad have been making Obei’s life hard lately.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A young kid, Tick, tells the PCs that she spied some Terra Triad guys carting Varrick, snoring loudly, into some warehouses earlier. She’ll lead them to the warehouse if they bring her along so she can report back to the Dumpling HQ for some evening bao.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Warehouse 26</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Warehouse 26 is an old building that is somehow still standing. Broken beams and windows keep most folks away. Inside, the PCs will find something completely different. It is a solid stone structure that has all the telltale signs of earthbending and is difficult to enter without a capable Earthbender. The entire structure has been fortified and converted into offices and head- quarters for both the San Ho Consortium and certain faces of the Terra Triad (like Steely Ning).</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varrick is held here until the Terra Triad moves him to the water treatment facility, when they set up the final bomb. He’s inside</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a windowless stone room rigged with a couple of traps San Ho designed personally. There are plenty of Terra Triad guards and mercenaries all over the warehouse along with Steely Ning herself, and San Ho might be here as well. If Varrick is rescued,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he will gladly tell the PCs everything he knows—loudly. Varrick will accompany the PCs on everything they do next if he is freed, offering assistance and helping to piece together further clues. If San Ho is here, he will flee as soon as the PCs start any trouble, presenting a good target for pursuit.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Searching through everything in Warehouse 26, the PCs find the plan to put bombs in the water treatment facility, including the placement of every bomb in the facility.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs find photographs of San Ho bribing Commissioner Chao. San Ho had the photos taken for their further blackmail potential, in case he needed to pressure Chao.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• San Ho has kept the inception agreement between Yinuo and Wakkanai for their original company—the one</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he was forced to divest from. The agreement strongly alludes that San Ho is actually Yinuo, with angered tagging from San Ho next to Wakkanai’s name calling her a traitor… and a note next to Varrick’s signature reading, “I’ll get you, you pompous turtle-duck!”</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">City Hall</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The current City Hall of Republic City is a large, beautiful, ornate stone building, now with spirit vines shot through it. The City Hall represents an attempt to keep Republic City working in conjunction with the spirit vines, instead of in opposition to them. The place has grand halls and beautiful galleries for the public, but the real operations of government take place in a maze of halls, agencies, Commissioners, and more—the hallmarks of a func- tional city government.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All three of the Utilities Commissioners can be found here, in their offices. Ke Xin and Gajii will both speak openly about the current ongoing issues around Wakkanai and the plant. Chao will try to avoid speaking with the PCs and will do everything she can to avoid admitting her corruption—but the PCs can always tell she’s hiding something. Wakkanai might be here, too, pleading with Ke Xin or Chao, or commiserating with Gajii.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leads</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs spy Wei Tia on his way to see Chao and can covertly listen in. Doing so clues them in to the bribery and exactly what it’s about, as well as indicating that something</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">significant is happening at the water treatment facility tonight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs find a copy of the original records surrounding Wakkanai getting the rights to the water treatment facility. Ke Xin’s notes indicate concern over</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">records of dangerous conduct and explosions at the facility in the past, with Yinuo’s name circled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Gajii has investigated the San Ho Consortium and found its address at a series of warehouses on the Republic City docks. She hasn’t pushed further on it, however, as her own aides have informed her that the area is heavily patrolled by the Terra Triad.</p>
