<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whether you’re playing this adventure as a one-shot or part of an ongoing campaign, the PCs were invited to attend the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">summit. If you’re not using the pregenerated characters, let the players define why they were invited and why they all chose to attend. The heroes should answer the following questions:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Why were you invited to attend the summit?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What do you personally want to achieve at the summit?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If your players are stumped on how to answer, you can suggest ideas: maybe they were invited as security or because someone in their group is especially skilled. You could even suggest that Taqu- kaq specially requested they attend and have the players answer the questions about their connection to him first. How and why the companions are here is up to them, and as the GM, you should ensure each player buys into their own reasoning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now that you’ve established why the PCs are at the sum- mit, introduce Taqukaq and use the questions below to craft a connection to Taqukaq as motivation for his decision to entrust the heroes with this delicate mission. Each player answers each question independently after the PCs have been introduced and the inciting incident established, although their answers can build off each other. <i>Players should do this whether they are using pregenerated characters or not.</i>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What were you doing when you first met Taqukaq?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What did you do to earn his trust?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What’s one thing he probably remembers about you?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Getting Started</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The start of the summit was an opening ceremony, where each of the five delegations introduced their members and performed an intricate display of their culture’s dances and music. The Fire Nation’s was exciting and bombastic, the Air Nation’s was grace- ful, the Water Tribe’s two delegations came together to create a dance both beautiful and poignant…and the Earth Kingdom’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">was a three-part opera retelling the life of the current Earth King.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Make sure the PCs have a chance to say what they’re doing and watching during the show. They might even participate in some of the displays if they want! But this is also a good chance to introduce the myriad important delegates, with the PCs’ attention drawn to these notable figures as they either watch or participate in the show.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After the show, the Fire Nations set off a breathtaking fire- work display, and the delegates mingled. This is when Khuchtei burst into the event, announcing the theft and demanding the thief reveal themself. After a few awkward moments when the thief didn’t step forward, Khuchtei announced security at the summit would increase, but the summit would go forward. She made sure to say that the culprit would be caught and, when apprehended, would be punished appropriately according to Fire Nation law.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This is when Taqukaq approaches the characters covertly, explaining his situation and asking for help. Let the players take it from there!</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember: <span class="p">At the beginning of the adventure, someone is guilty—but their exact identity isn’t yet determined. You should decide who the culprit is based on your players’ actions and interest during the investigation.</span>
