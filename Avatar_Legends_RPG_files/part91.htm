<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What the guidelines demand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rely on the guidelines to steer your story and maintain a tone and theme consistent with that of the Avatarverse. Keep them in mind always; they are useful when it comes to building the world, in coming up with story ideas, and in imagining how NPCs react. They will help you reach the agendas and are flexible enough to cover a lot of different situations. For example, <i>be the companions’ biggest fan </i>means you should both provide them with opportu- nities to show off their powers and triumph over adversity and challenge them by showcasing the way their actions lead to mean- ingful (if unexpected) changes to the larger world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If more than one guideline applies in a given situation, that’s okay! As long as you follow a guideline that supports your agen- das, there won’t be a wrong choice between the different guide- lines. In the end, there’s no difference between focusing on <i>seeking consequences beyond death </i>and <i>using imbalance instead of evil</i>, if both guidelines lead you toward conflicts that fit the Avatarverse!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, you don’t need to remember every single guide- line all the time—if you ever need to remind yourself in the moment or if you aren’t sure which to follow, check out your GM reference sheets!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What the rules demand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Stick to the rules and be consistent. If a PC is about to be knocked out by taking another condition, don’t backtrack or fudge that fact when they tell you they don’t have any conditions left to mark.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since player characters can’t be permanently killed (except for rare circumstances, when there’s agreement between the player and the GM), keeping to the rules only enhances your story. After all, not even the Avatar wins every single fight!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Keeping to the rules helps to create a consistent space for your players to engage the fiction; if they know they can never lose— or never win!—because you have your thumb on the scale, their choices won’t be real or meaningful. Letting the dice fall where they may means that both you and they know the decisions they make matter to the fiction you all build together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that “always say what the rules demand” does not mean that you must always call for rolls for every tiny action. You as GM adjudicate when the situation is uncertain, and when a move is called for. The rules are a tool for telling great stories together; you shouldn’t ever ignore them, but focus on invoking them when it’s productive for the story!</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM<span class="s106">ing </span>for Other Games</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There are lots of tabletop RPGs out there, and each one requires unique expertise and skills. No two RPGs are entirely alike, and while some skills from one RPG may overlap with those required by an- other, you should always pay close attention to the specific needs of the RPG you’re playing or running today instead of assuming it works like the one you played or ran yesterday. So as you read this section, you may pick up on interesting ideas or techniques that can help you out with other RPGs…but ev- erything here is first and foremost geared toward</p>
<p class="s59" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game<span class="s27">.</span>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What honesty demands</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, say what honesty demands—never lie to the other players. You are their only lens into the fiction—you don’t have to tell them every single thing that’s true, but you can’t tell them anything untrue to preserve surprises. Phrases like “you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">think,” “you believe,” or “you can’t tell” are very helpful here. For instance, if asked who’s in the gallery and you know an assassin lurks in the statuary, don’t say, “No one.” You might say some- thing like, “You think you’re alone, but it’s dark and there are plenty of shadows around,” or you might call for a PC to <span class="s11">assess the situation </span>or even <span class="s11">push their luck </span>to search the area. Lying to your players or misleading them only makes it harder for them to get on the same page with you and to trust you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, stick to the truths you’ve established. If you decid- ed before the session that the kidnapped princess is in the Spirit World, don’t change your mind and plop her in the theatre just because the PCs went there first. Follow your fiction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But even as you stick to established truths, you can expand, elaborate, or manipulate those truths. While you shouldn’t ignore truths you’ve established, it’s perfectly fine to add new facts that make the game more fun. If you decide that a spirit can “only” be defeated by saltwater, but the companions steal a scroll that contains a special ritual others believe will appease the spirit…don’t have the scroll turn out to be a dud. The ritual works, in some fashion. After all, the ritual need not “defeat” the spirit. Or maybe it does, by creating a salty rainstorm effect in the area. Either way, you as GM have accepted a new truth, but stayed honest by sticking to what you had planned. On top of that, you’ve rewarded players for playing the game and seizing new opportunities!</p>
