</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once within the Spirit Library, you have the chance to search through the greatest archive of knowledge, history, and learn- ing ever created. There are countless wonders inside—ancient tomes and scrolls, impressive learning mechanisms and tools, cultural art from deep history, and more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To get to any of it, though, one must contend with He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Dealing with Wan Shi Tong</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wan Shi Tong is the gatekeeper, guardian, master, and curator of the Spirit Library. Nearly anyone who comes to the library will eventually encounter him directly in some way, and how they choose to handle the situation will determine whether they leave the library peacefully and in good standing, or whether they flee with a giant owl spirit chasing them, claws extended.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Fighting Wan Shi Tong</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Wan Shi Tong is a powerful spirit, ancient, wise, and just a bit snippy. In the Spirit Library, his great domain, he’s even great- er—and he rarely if ever leaves the library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fighting Wan Shi Tong isn’t really an option. Even for those who pass through a spirit portal and still have access to their bend- ing, his power within the library is just too great to meaningfully oppose and defeat. You might be able to hold him off for a bit,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">but you’ll never be able to subdue him for an extended period. In terms of the mechanics, Wan Shi Tong cannot lose his balance or be taken out within the library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a result, combat exchanges are never appropriate for fighting Wan Shi Tong. Instead, use the basic moves to try to knock him away, flee from his talons, or deceive him and escape. For example, an intrepid Airbender might push a gust of wind at the enormous owl, sending him spiraling away, by <span class="s11">relying on their skills and training</span>. Or a Waterbender might throw a water whip across the great spirit’s beak as he dives in with talons outstretched, stopping him at the last second—but that’s so dangerous, the Waterbender is <span class="s11">pushing their luck</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">From the GM’s perspective, Wan Shi Tong is best treated as an environmental threat instead of an enemy NPC. He doesn’t have conditions, as such—again, he cannot be taken out, and his emotions are largely in his own control. His balance is also firmly established, as an ancient and powerful spirit; PCs aren’t going to be able to battle him by causing him to lose his balance somehow, although they might be able to call on him to act</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part109.htm#bookmark314" class="s25">differently by bargaining with a valuable piece of knowledge (see Seeking Information on page 12).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Of course, Wan Shi Tong can still inflict fatigue, conditions, and balance shifts upon the PCs as GM moves. If he gets his talons or beak on a PC, then he generally inflicts at least 3-fa- tigue—he’s quite a dangerous foe. PCs are better off distracting him, knocking him out of the way temporarily, and generally avoiding him than pursuing any kind of outright confrontation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you bargain with Wan Shi Tong using your own valuable knowledge, roll with <span class="s52">Harmony</span>. On a hit, Wan Shi Tong is interested and allows you to freely investigate the library in exchange for your knowledge. On a 10+, he is particularly impressed; he’ll assign you a Knowledge Seeker to help guide you to exactly what you seek. On a miss, Wan Shi Tong takes your knowledge but still doesn’t trust you; mark a condition and expect your every move here to be watched.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fighting Wan Shi Tong is far from the only option for dealing with him. While the great spirit might be a bit antisocial towards humans, he is always interested and invested in learning new things. He might not immediately believe that a silly human knows something he doesn’t…but once the information starts to flow, he becomes invested.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you want to bargain with Wan Shi Tong to gain access to the library, you can use this move: You must have <i>“valu- able knowledge” </i>to bargain—and Wan Shi Tong himself is the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ultimate arbiter of whether or not your proffered knowledge is valuable. That said, any knowledge that is in some way <i>real</i>—an actual new thing to learn, as opposed to something made up or nonsensical—is enticing to Wan Shi</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tong. The great spirit might har- rumph if offered information that is less novel or spectacular…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but ultimately he is so devoted to learning, he will accept the knowledge.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Bargaining with Wan Shi Tong after you have access to the library is best handled with the basic moves—<b>plead </b>and <b>trick</b>, for example—or by trying to <b>call on him to live up to his principle</b>. For that purpose, treat Wan Shi Tong as having</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a principle of Knowledge +3.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On a hit, Wan Shi Tong gives you permission to explore the library; as long as you give him</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part109.htm#bookmark314" class="s25">your knowledge and don’t violate his rules, you may remain. The advantage of having a Knowledge Seeker guide, and the disadvantage of being watched, are highlighted in the moves for seeking infor- mation within the library (page 12).</a> After all, merely convinc-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing Wan Shi Tong to allow you to stay does not ensure you find what you seek.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Eventually, you might find yourself fleeing from the great spirit while his talons are extended and his neck elongated. It’s a bad situation to be in!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To escape, you have to create an opportunity for yourself, whether by hiding and getting Wan Shi Tong to lose track of you, or temporarily stunning the spirit. If he continues to be engaged with you, you have no chance of slipping away. But once you have an opportunity to escape, then you can use this move to try to get away!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Questions</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Being <i>“hidden from Wan Shi Tong” </i>means that the great spirit and his Knowledge Seekers don’t know where you currently are when you try to sneak out. Having been <i>“able to walk and observe the library openly,” </i>freely, and without constraint also gives you an advantage getting back out. But if Wan Shi Tong is enraged</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at you, and if you’ve stolen anything from the library (including knowledge), then escape is that much more difficult.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As long as you roll a hit, you escape! But if you roll a 7–9, you have to choose to either leave something important behind or mark 2-fatigue. And on a miss, you not only don’t escape—you get caught by one of the spirits deeper in the library! You have to deal with them to create another chance to escape.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The whole group of companions can use this move to escape all together, with one player rolling for everyone. None of the PCs can <span class="s11">help </span>by marking fatigue on this move—the move itself already covers everyone working together. On a 7–9, each mem- ber of the group must choose to either mark 2-fatigue or leave something behind.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This move is for sojourners who are known to Wan Shi Tong and who move about the library in obvious, open fashion. If you want to take the time to peruse the bookshelves, not worrying about whether or not a Knowledge Seeker spots you at the end of a row of books, then this is the move for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Seeking information while welcome and accepted into the library is always a safer endeavor than seeking information while sneaking around. This first move is for openly moving through the library and finding your answers without trying to hide.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Having a Knowledge Seeker guide means that you’ve either convinced one of Wan Shi Tong’s servant spirits to aid you, or Wan Shi Tong has granted you their service himself. Whether or not your visit has been <i>“relatively brief” </i>is ultimately up to the GM, although it’s largely based on whether or not you’ve made many moves in the library, and how long each of those moves has taken to resolve in the fiction.</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">“Are you allowed to freely and without restriction move through- out the library?” <span class="p">is a question about how much access Wan Shi Tong has granted you. If he’s watching you carefully, or if he’s specifically forbade you to go to certain areas or do certain things, then the answer is no.</span>

<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you have any notion of what the answer might be or where it might live in the library?” <span class="p">is a question about how much you know about the very topic you’re investigating. If you are investigating “How can we destroy all earthbending everywhere?” and you haven’t the faintest idea of where to even begin, then the answer to the move’s question is “no.”</span>

<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">If your search <i>“takes a long time,” </i>the only cost is marking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1-fatigue (and everyone participating in the search for knowl- edge must pay that cost), but you also spend a lot of time in the library. If you keep searching, remember that your visit won’t be “relatively brief” anymore.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If <i>“your search makes Wan Shi Tong suspicious,” </i>he starts watching you more closely, asking questions about your search and whether it’s worthy of his library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you <i>“find a limited version of the answer,” </i>then the GM will tell you why and how the answer is limited—it gives you enough in- formation to move forward, but it may not resolve every element of your question. You might keep searching for more information based on what you learn, but any further searches require you to make the move again and your visit is no longer “brief.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a miss, you can still go for the information you seek, but you’re likely contending with difficult conditions or Wan Shi Tong’s forbiddance. You can try to negotiate with the great spirit for access, or you can just break the rules and try to get your answers anyway…</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a hit, you find the answer (the GM will tell you where and what it is). On a 7–9, you are also caught out by a Knowledge Seeker—it’s only a matter of time before Wan Shi Tong comes looking for you. On a miss, just as you find where the answer is but before you can read any tomes or scrolls to actually discov- er it, Wan Shi Tong finds you…and he is not happy.</p>

It covers situations when Wan Shi Tong doesn’t know you’re here, and when you want to hide what you’re looking for.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Every PC who sneaks through the library must mark a con- dition—the move covers the whole group moving through the library, but each member of the group has to pay the cost!</p>

<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Keeping your presence secret from Wan Shi Tong and his Knowl- edge Seekers” <span class="p">means that you’ve managed to get into the library entirely without them noticing you. If they have any idea you’re here, you’ve lost some of the element of stealth!</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Has your visit to the library been relatively brief” <span class="p">has to do with how long you’ve spent in the library overall, and whether or not that duration starts to work against you in remaining hidden.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Your presence and actions in the library have been innocuous and harmless so far” <span class="p">when you haven’t done anything particularly destructive, dangerous, or violative of the library’s rules. If all you’ve done is sneak around hallways so far, then the answer to this question is yes. But if you, say, smashed a glass case to get at the scroll inside…then the answer is no.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Keeping to the safe or openly accessible parts of the library” <span class="p">is all about being conservative with where you’re sneaking around. If you’re ranging all over the library, including its most restricted archives, then the answer to this question is “no.” If the answer is “yes,” then you can expect the information you find to be appro- priate to the more public, accessible areas—you won’t find any deep, complicated secrets.</span>
</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On a 7–9, you’re caught, but not before you find and obtain the answer. The Knowledge Seeker who finds you won’t immediate- ly attack or anything—it runs off to go fetch Wan Shi Tong. You might still be able to bargain with the great spirit…possibly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On a miss, though, there’s no bargaining. He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things looms above you, and does not approve of these human intruders. Brace yourselves.</p>
