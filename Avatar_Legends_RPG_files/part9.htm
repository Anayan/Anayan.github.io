</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While all the rules and advice in this book are designed to support stories in the Avatarverse, there are a few core ideas you need to keep in mind while you play. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game </span>tells stories of adventure and action against the back- drop of the Avatarverse, a fantasy setting in which any individual person can change the course of history…but no one can escape the decisions of the past.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In other words, the potential for change is infinite—there is always a new challenge to be met, a new future to be built, a new legacy to be forged—but the Avatarverse is a place in which people remember what came before, whether that be</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the great deeds of Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko, the terrible destruction wrought by Fire Lord Sozin, or the innumerable warlords and bandits that lived and died long before Avatar Kyoshi first learned earthbending. The past matters, now more than ever, and the consequences of your actions will echo long after you are gone.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The stories you tell through this game are not stories of the battle between good and evil. Instead, they are stories about how people try to make a better future while dealing with the problems of the past. They are stories about misguided figures who take things too far and heroes who make sacrifices to find compromises and new ways forward in equal measure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part51.htm#bookmark121" class="s25">Your characters in this story are always capable heroes with the training and willpower necessary to make the world a better place. They’re drawn together by events that called them to undertake an important struggle—see Outline the Inciting Incident, page </a>111—but that goal is too large for them to accomplish overnight. Instead, they will have to work together to make a meaningful difference. Sometimes that means they must discover a hidden truth or deep learning; sometimes it means they must win the trust of a worthy ally; and sometimes that means they must defeat a dangerous and powerful foe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each of these goals is complicated by the characters’ own in- ternal struggles, the way they are torn between their principles as they deal with problems. For example, the heroes might finally confront a murderous bandit who has been terrorizing the near- by villages, only to discover the bandit is keeping a community of people fed who would have otherwise starved. Will the heroes set things right no matter the cost? Or do they seek redemption for the bandit based on his good deeds?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Even though each episode’s story will likely be about a partic- ular conflict or villain or problem, the decisions the companions make echo throughout the setting. And when you play a full campaign, you not only encounter the long-term effects of your own actions, but you also see how your character is changed and shaped by the decisions you make. Forging a better future also means forging a new version of yourself!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Eras</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each game of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>begins with your group picking an era as the backdrop for your game. The eras are each tied to the span of an Avatar’s life—except for the Hundred Year War era during which Avatar Aang was frozen—and focuses on distinct themes which define the type of game you play. The full text of Chapter 2 describes these eras more deeply, but here’s a quick list that describes the rough focus and details of each era:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Kyoshi Era </span>covers the events right after <i>The Shadow of Kyoshi </i>novel. Play in the Kyoshi Era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if you want to fight in battles against rogues and bandits and deal with governmental corruption as the nations establish their borders.</p>
<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roku Era <span class="p">covers the time right after Sozin became Fire Lord and before Roku married. Play in the Roku Era if you want to deal with tensions between different nations and the trials of main- taining an uneasy peace.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Hundred Year War Era </span>focuses on the time just before Avatar Aang’s awakening at the begin- ning of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Hun- dred Year War era if you want to rebel against unjust rule, protect the weak, and stand up to tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Aang Era </span>is set immediately after the events of the <i>Imbalance </i>comics trilogy, some time after the end of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Aang Era if you want to heal the world after trage- dy and help push it into a brighter future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Korra Era </span>covers a period that takes place after the events of the <i>Ruins of the Empire </i>comic trilogy, sometime after the end of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. Play in the Korra Era if you want to deal with the repercussions of imperialism and play in a modernized era.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Four Nations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For centuries, the world has been split into four distinct nations each with their own cultures and customs. While individuals from these nations often form lifelong bonds of friendship and love, the nations themselves are often in conflict. Your heroes may travel from place to place or stay in one location, but they must always contend with the politics and peoples of the places they visit during their adventures.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about the full history of each of the Four Nations—and locations that only exist in later eras, like Repub- lic City—in Chapter 2. For now, here’s a short summary of each of the Four Nations, their history, and some of the most import- ant issues that are likely to arise if they appear in your game.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The largest of the Four Nations, the Earth Kingdom has been ruled by a monarchy for much of its history. It is known for its sheer vastness and diversity of both geography and peoples. De- spite the history of hardship in the rural areas neglected by the government, the citizens of the Earth Kingdom are known for their strength, resilience, and unyielding nature. When they are knocked down, they rarely stay down for long. They draw their strength from the immortal earth and immovable mountains.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation is located on a group of islands to the west of the Earth Kingdom. It boasts an impressive military, and its navy is a force to be reckoned with. This is in large part because travel by water is a necessity on the islands. In addition to its military, the Fire Nation is known for its robust economy and industrial achievements. The Fire Nation is filled with people who value innovation, technology, discipline, and strength of all kinds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark82" class="s28">Determined to focus on a spiritual life separate from the rest of the world, the Air Nomads roamed the world while maintaining four distinct Air Temples in nearly inaccessible locations. Tragically, Fire Lord Sozin ordered the Fire Nation military to kill all Air Nomads at the start of the Hundred Year War (page </a>58); Avatar Aang was</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">the only survivor. Over a century later, a number of people gained airbending abilities during the Harmonic Convergence, ushering in a new Air Nation under the guidance of Aang’s son, Tenzin.</p>

</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Divided into the Southern Water Tribe and the Northern Water Tribe—alongside a smaller group based in the Foggy Swamp— the people of the polar tribes are skilled at sailing and navigating challenging terrain. However, there is a long history of tension between the two tribes, and the Southern Water Tribe has often struggled while their Northern counterpart thrived. Both are known for their powerful loyalty and unrelenting perseverance, like the waves of the ocean crashing onto the beaches’ shores.</p>

<p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 21pt;text-align: left;">The Trainings</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">People of the Four Nations have mastered many types of trainings, each requiring years of practice. Ranging from elemental bending to weapons and technology, these trainings both empower the heroes of these stories and define how they see the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Waterbending</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Water is movement, change, and grace. The element cannot be broken and even in its most rigid forms has the ability to melt and reform. It is a dynam- ic element, subtle but powerful. Waterbending is inspired by the real-world martial art <i>Tai Chi. </i>This style’s flowing motions allow a Waterbender to use their element defensively to redirect an opponent’s attack, or offensively in the form of water whips, ice attacks, or large waves. Certain Waterbenders can also redirect energy paths in the body to heal injuries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earthbending</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Earth is strong, stable, and constant. The element stands the test of time; it is a steady element, bold and unyielding. Earthbending is inspired by the real-world <i>Hung Ga</i>, known for solid stances and blunt punches, with fists formed into di- verse shapes and toughened by striking exercises. Earthbenders can harness the formative energy of the earth, powerfully punch boulders, and ride platforms of stone to impossible heights.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Firebending</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Fire is pure energy, destruction, and regeneration. The element can either con- sume everything around it in a powerful blaze, or heat it with a brilliant inten- sity that is impossible to ignore. It is an energetic element, bright and mighty. Firebending is inspired by the real-world <i>Northern Shaolin</i>, associated with the Shaolin Monastery. These fighters use fast, athletic movements including jumps, spins, and extended linear stances, powered by breath. Firebenders can exhale fire, wield flames like daggers, and grow a singular flame into a raging bonfire.</p>

</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Airbending</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Air is flexible, playful, but still powerful. The element goes where it wills and expands and contracts to meet its environment. Air is an open element, breed- ing freedom and bolstering spirits. Airbending is loosely based on the real-world <i>Baguazhang</i>. The martial art’s circular motions and footwork allows one person to defend against multiple enemies. Airbenders are quick and nimble using their skills to defend from and evade attacks. Airbenders can ride balls of spinning air, quell cyclones, and sweep even the heaviest objects into weightlessness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Weapons</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Weapons are precise, intimidating, and fierce. They demand craftsmanship to create and discipline to master. In the right hands, a weapon can level the playing field between a non-bender and a bender. Fighters trained in the use of weapons can come from any nation. Their first specialty likely comes from their home nation with a weapon and fighting style unique to their home re-</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">gion, but it can also include unarmed combat such as chi-blocking. Weapons in the Avatarverse take inspiration from real world Asian and Indigenous cultures, such as the Chinese <i>dao </i>(saber) and other traditional weapons.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Technology is brilliance, power, and innovation. It changes what is possible and pushes the boundaries of established norms. It is intricate, yet mighty. Techno- logical innovation can be found throughout the Four Nations; heroes who use technology spring up all over the world. Of course, advanced technology varies by the era—an Earth Kingdom technologist in the Roku Era might use smoke bombs and traps, whereas a technologist in the Korra Era might use an electrified rod or mechanized vehicles!</p>
