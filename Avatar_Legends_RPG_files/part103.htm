<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An <span class="s23">adventure </span>is a self-contained, episodic set of conflicts, NPCs, and mechanics that you, as the GM, prepare before you sit down to play with your group. Adventures don’t lay out a specific series of events that <i>must </i>occur, but instead frame a conflict and establish the stakes. Ultimately, the players drive the plot of any adventure with their actions, so adventure planning is much more about pre- paring the conflicts than deciding on how those conflicts resolve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Creating Adventures</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you prepare an adventure for your players, gather all of the necessary components—a conflict, a cast of characters, locations—and prep as much as you feel is necessary. You can always follow the guidance and tools in <span class="s23">Chapter 8: Running the Game </span>and <span class="s23">Chapter 9: Seasons &amp; Campaigns </span>to offer your players challenges and conflicts keyed to whatever goes on in your game at any given moment, but it can be useful to have some material ready in advance. That said, there’s no one right way to create an adventure; don’t feel like you need to hit every note of your adventure prep every time you play.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Center Your Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you craft any conflicts or NPCs for your adventure, figure out where you’re starting your game, including the era. If this</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is a one-shot, you could start any time in any era; just pick a location based on what you think is exciting, or focus on what your players are interested in. If your adventure is part of an on- going campaign, pick a location that makes sense for the fiction. Maybe your players said they were traveling to another town in search of a foe—set your adventure in that town as they seek their quarry. Or if the scope of your game is Ba Sing Se and your players indicated at the end of last session they wanted to inter- rogate a minister in the Upper Ring, set your adventure nearby.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">No matter what location you choose, it should be a place that embroils the companions in conflict right away. There’s no point wasting time in your adventure traveling from place to place if nothing happens. Think of the starting point of your adventure like the opening of an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. The heroes arrive in a town…and disaster strikes, or there is someone following them, or they notice something strange in the distance!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What is this place like?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you know where the adventure starts, you can ask yourself what the location looks, smells, and feels like. You can outline where the players could go, and what places in the adventure might be important to various NPC groups. You can never cover every single base, nor should you try—PCs nearly always go somewhere you hadn’t expected. That said, it’s always good to have a few locations sketched out in your mind so you don’t have to come up with everything on the spot, and so you can build on something that exists when inventing on the fly. Remember that you can always ask your players leading questions about the lo- cation to help fill in details based on the characters’ backgrounds and experiences, taking some of the pressure off you! Some general locations to think of are:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• An interesting spot to start the adventure and frame the central conflict of the adventure</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Places the various factions can be found—a headquarters or popular gathering spot</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• A few Avatarverse quirks about the location to make the world feel real, like monuments to the past or colorful local traditions</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You don’t need to add any mechanics or rules for the backdrops you envision. Instead, focus on how those spaces might help you frame the conflicts of the adventure and convey the themes of the era. If you want to make Republic City look busy and bustling, then describe an open air market; if you want the city</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to seem gritty and filled with criminal elements, an underground bending ring might be a better fit!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Central Location</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You’re playing in the Korra Era; at the end of last session, King Wu (may his reign end in democracy) tasked the companions with bring- ing in one of Kuvira’s former generals hiding out in a remote Earth Kingdom village. This general helped Kuvira run numerous worker camps and so far has evaded trial in Republic City for his crimes. You decided to start your adventure in the village where the general is hiding, close to the site of one of Kuvira’s forced labor camps. The village initially refused to bend to Kuvira’s will, but she forced them to surrender and slowly isolated and starved the inhabitants, leaving them broken and vulnerable when the general returned…or at least, so he imagined.</p>

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Identify a Central Conflict</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve decided where to set your adventure, craft the <span class="s23">central conflict</span>—the main source of drama and opposition the players will encounter during the episode. Each central conflict needs to act as an anchor for the adventure, a complex encoun- ter that doesn’t have a straightforward answer and requires the players to dig into the source of whatever strife they’ve come across. Sometimes a good central conflict stems from a previous adventure, but often you can root your central conflict in the themes of the era or the realities of the location you’ve picked, representing the natural, emergent disagreements that exist across the Four Nations.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Central Conflict</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When the companions arrive at the village to confront the general, the village has already captured him. Some villagers are intent on in- terning him for life without a trial and are not willing to give him over to the PCs; they mistrust “Republic City justice” after seeing what happened with Kuvira herself. Other villagers insist that the gen-</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">eral be turned over to the PCs for a real trial. The conflict simmers throughout the entire community at all times.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The key to coming up with good conflicts quickly is thinking about meaningful disagreement, places in the setting where people have real reasons, beyond mere selfishness and villainy, to oppose each other and pursue their own objectives. If the companions show up and find out the general is a bad guy with lackeys and scary bending powers, then they have an opponent to fight, but not much else, no real decision to make or conflict to explore. It’s much more interesting if they find out that the people of the village have their own ideas about justice—now they have real problems to solve, without obvious answers!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What if the companions do nothing?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve come up with a central conflict, determine what happens <span class="s23">if the companions do nothing</span>. The players are free to make whatever decisions they want once you’ve presented the conflict, and they may even decide to do nothing—or they</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">might even leave the area entirely! Mapping out a logical course of action gives you the ability to realistically portray the conflict around whatever actions the players decide to take. You can then bring those consequences to bear and show the players how their decision to avoid the conflict affected the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Don’t count the players out, though! If they do sit back and let the conflict unfurl, you can act on your prep and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">portray the world moving forward with them. But at any moment the players may decide to engage the conflict and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">change the course of the story! By pushing things forward in an interesting way, you create room—and a pressing need— for them to jump into the action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Think of this part of prep as getting ready to turn up the temperature in your story. If the players get the sense that inaction or avoidance means that the plot is put on pause, they won’t have much reason to think their decisions matter or jump into the fray. But if they know you’ll move the story forward no matter what they do, they’ll be more inclined to take risks and participate.</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use the Themes</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">If you’re struggling to develop a conflict, each era comes with five themes central to stories told in that era. Pick one of the themes to focus your adventure around. Those themes help anchor your adventure in the era you’re playing in, and there’s enough background in the setting for you to drive the action forward. Leaving the specifics of the conflict open means you allow your players to drive the action of the adventure. If you’re still struggling, remember: themes are also linked to each nation’s <i>Threats and Challenges</i>. You can use the conflicts we’ve presented there for adventures as well!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Prep for PC Inaction</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The conflict between those who wish to punish the general here and those who wish to send him back to Republic City for trial comes to a boiling point. Some decide to take matters into their own hands, meting out a sentence on the general now, before anyone can take him away from the village. As they approach the prison, other villagers stand in their way. The two sides erupt into a vicious, loud, angry argument, which devolves rapidly into an actual fight. A few Earthbenders break into the general’s windowless cell, but as the general tries to escape in the chaos, someone encases the general in stone, accidentally killing him in the heat of the moment and ending the fight. Both sides, stunned at the sudden violence of what’s happened, start to drift away from the village, no longer sure they can trust their neighbors. The perpetrator is rapidly hidden from retribution, as well.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above example has a lot of unanswered questions: how did the village capture this general? Are the general’s allies coming to rescue him? How can the players convince the village to spare this man? All of these questions might come into play as the com- panions interact with the conflict, but—if they choose to remain distant—you’re prepared to let things play out on their own…</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How do twists and ties deepen conflict?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you have time before the session, you can also <span class="s23">plan a twist to your conflict</span>. The Avatarverse is complex, and most conflicts are based around the tension between balance and imbalance. A twist in the adventure complicates the conflict even further, both draw- ing players closer to it and pushing them away from easy answers.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Twist</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The general hid in the village because his daughter also lives there. Instead of plotting revenge, the general tried to live peacefully with her and his granddaughter, forsaking all violence once he saw what his work as a member of the Earth Empire did to the lives of the peo- ple. He didn’t even resist when the locals discovered who he was and apprehended him. Should the companions even consider taking him to Republic City when he’s clearly trying to turn over a new leaf and live a quiet, peaceful life helping this town and his family?</p>

</span>
</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What do you want to do?</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players often have specific goals for their characters or things they want to happen so their character can progress through their story. It’s always a good idea to check-in with your players at the end of an adventure, asking them what they would like to do in the next few episodes. Their answers can inspire the next adventure and give you ideas to add different features from your players’ stories into the adventure you’re crafting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you run an adventure, you might find that interesting twists often present themselves. The introduction of an NPC the players really like—perhaps a kind, young Earthbender from the village—might prompt you to think about how she might be related to the central conflict, allowing you to establish her as the general’s daughter. However, sometimes it is a good idea to sketch out what that twist could be in advance, as a way of set-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">ting up reveals or dramatic turns you can use if things get boring.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But a twist that isn’t rooted in anything—like a random spirit attack or a sudden and meaningless betrayal—won’t land. Any twist you decide to add into the story must be centered around characters, their drives, and what they could realistically do giv- en the situation. The twist also should not contradict anything you’ve already established through the course of the game; you can’t say the general isn’t really the general if you’ve already established no doubt about his identity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Alternatively, you can also <span class="s23">tie a conflict to a player’s person- al story</span>. Thanks to the nature of the game, all adventures are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inherently tied to the companions through the choices the PCs make as they explore the conflict. As the GM you’re always look- ing for golden opportunities to tie your adventure to a PC’s story in a new and exciting way, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One way to spotlight a player character is to tie the conflict di- rectly to a feature of their backstory and characters important to them. This gives the players additional buy-in for the adventure you’ve crafted and gives them a chance to explore different facets of their character.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Character Tie</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Successor finds that estranged members of her family are the ones leading the charge to punish the general here, in the village. They suffered greatly under Kuvira and the Earth Empire, and they aren’t about to accept help from someone like the Successor—family that didn’t even bother helping them during the war!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part104.htm#bookmark308" class="s25">Like anchor NPCs (page 263),</a> character ties work best when they focus on one character and push on that character’s specific story. Try to avoid situations where every adventure has a tie</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for every character; it strains credulity and can make the entire adventure seem contrived and messy.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Outline Main Characters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you have established a setting and central conflict, <span class="s23">outline the main characters </span>who have a stake in the conflict and can push it in interesting ways. Knowing who the key players are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in any adventure is important, because the companions need interesting NPCs to interact with in order to accomplish almost anything. These characters also provide the main opposition for your players in the conflict, so think about their motivations and goals ahead of time. At a minimum, sketch out the name, role, and stats for NPCs who are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Central to the conflict—who is the conflict about and why?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• In a position of power at the adventure location.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example Central NPCs</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Jiro, the general. Drive: repent for what I’ve done.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Chang, the mayor. Drive: keep everyone happy so I’m re-elected.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Wei, leader of angry townsfolk. Drive: hurt Jiro like he hurt my sister.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Yilin, leader of forgiving townsfolk. Drive: stop my friends and family from doing something they’ll regret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s also useful to have <span class="s23">a few general NPCs </span>you can throw in who are interesting, but may not have a clear connection to the plot. Players tend to take action in unexpected ways and having a small library of interesting NPCs means you can pull one out and use them when you haven’t prepared for what the players decide to do. Tying them to the location of your story means they automatically have some sort of stake in the action, but you can quickly define what that is while running your game.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example General NPCs</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Hongyi, local merchant. Drive: regain my standing after coming back from the labor camps.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Yuxi, impressionable youth. Drive: discover what happened to my brother who left town during Kuvira’s reign.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Kun, chief constable. Drive: exploit whoever I can to grab more power.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Make sure you take the time to <span class="s23">stat up each NPC central to the conflict</span>. It saves you a lot of heartache later on when running combat scenes to already know what techniques each charac-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ter has, how long their balance track is, etc. You might decide mid-session that a previously underused character, perhaps one of your general NPCs, needs to be a major NPC, but you already know those central characters are going to matter a lot!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Preparing NPCs is also a good practice for running more inter- esting combats. When you first start running the game, the basic techniques might seem like a lot to grapple with by themselves, but the more experience everyone at the table has, the easier ad- ventures are to run—giving NPCs interesting techniques to throw at your players keeps combat fun for everyone at the table!</p>
