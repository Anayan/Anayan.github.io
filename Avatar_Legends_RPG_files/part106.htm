<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wan Shi Tong, the Knowledge Spirit, He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things, is a famed and powerful spirit of great accom- plishments...none greater than the creation, maintenance, and growth of his Spirit Library. This grand edifice has been a true wonder of the world since the time of its creation. Over the eons that the library has stood, Wan Shi Tong’s fox-like Knowledge Seekers have spread out across the world to collect tomes, codi- ces, scrolls, manuscripts, and any other sources of information, establishing the library as the greatest repository of knowledge in either the Spirit World or the physical world. Sojourners have long picked their way across the dangers of the Si Wong Desert to find the library, committing some of their own knowledge to Wan Shi Tong’s vast trove in exchange for the right to read and peruse at their leisure…as long as they aren’t seeking knowledge to use against others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The role of the Spirit Library in the world at large has gone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">through many different incarnations, from a well-known and acknowledged resource to a nigh-mythical repository of long- lost secrets. In turn, Wan Shi Tong’s relationship with humanity defines the role of the library. In past eras, Wan Shi Tong still believed, at least in part, that humanity could prove itself worthy of knowledge and could expand his stores, but as Wan Shi Tong’s mistrust in humanity and its motives grew, so too did the seclu- sion of the Library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After Avatar Aang and his friends betrayed Wan Shi Tong’s trust by seeking knowledge to defeat the Fire Nation, Wan Shi Tong took the Spirit Library back with him into the Spirit World. But the Spirit Library has always been and will always be a valu- able beacon of learning to any who wish to expand their minds and come to a greater understanding of the world around them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Spirit Library of Wan Shi Tong is a fantastic and useful location to add to any campaign of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game</span>. Whether acting as a source of answers otherwise unattainable, as the object of a quest for some specific piece</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of information, or as a fascinating and marvelous location to visit, explore, and maybe even defend, the Spirit Library is a unique and interesting locale for heroes in any era to visit. Player characters (PCs) might choose to seek the library for its secrets, even to learn new techniques and trainings, while antagonistic non-player characters (NPCs) might try to use the library to pursue their own unbalanced goals. The pages here give game- masters (GMs) and players all the tools needed to bring Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library to life in their own game!</p>
<p class="s15" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is the Spirit Library?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Spirit Library is the domain of Wan Shi Tong, a powerful and ancient owl spirit. The exact founding of the Spirit Library isn’t known to the world, but it is as astonishingly ancient as Wan Shi Tong himself. Until a few thousand years before the Korra Era, Wan Shi Tong kept the library in the Spirit World, where he collected knowledge. His servants, the Knowledge Seekers, are capable and cunning. These fox spirits have sky blue eyes and a keen sense of where to pursue new knowledge. They regularly pass from the Spirit World to the physical world, to collect books and tomes and bring them back to the library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Some time later, Wan Shi Tong decided to bring the magnif- icent palace-like structure into the area that would one day be known as the Si Wong Desert within the Earth Kingdom. Tales of the vast and beautiful building began to spread among humans, originating with those desert travelers who beheld its glory.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Part of the reason to bring the Spirit Library to the physical world was to make it easier for the Knowledge Seekers to find and bring back learnings. But for a time, Wan Shi Tong also welcomed all mortals to the library. Anyone could access the library and its vast stores of information, as long as they brought some knowl- edge to contribute in turn. Of course, Wan Shi Tong didn’t tolerate the use of the library’s knowledge for destructive or violent behav- ior, and certainly forbade anything that threatened the knowledge stored there…but otherwise, the exchange of knowledge was the single most important rule for any visitor of the library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For eons, this relationship was beneficial and more or less stable for both Wan Shi Tong and the mortals who sought the Library. There were those who sought to abuse Wan Shi Tong’s hospitality, but they were relatively few and far between, easily dealt with by the great spirit’s talons. But across those eons, the world was wild and spread out enough that those most likely to come upon the library either lived near it and had an interest in a stable relationship with the great spirit, or were in sync with Wan Shi Tong’s own beliefs. As the world grew more and more connected, and those with darker interests came to seek it, so too changed the way Wan Shi Tong felt about the library and its visitors.</p>
