</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The adventure starts with the PCs in Boat Bottom, a fishing village alongside the coast of the western Earth Kingdom, just southeast of the great cosmopolitan expanse of Yu Dao. An unusual storm of activity is brewing in this quiet seaside town; the merchants and fishers celebrate booming business thanks to corporate visitors in the area, and the constant flow of people in and out of town helps rumors fly of a master thief hiding in Boat Bottom. Wanted posters pepper the docks with the image of a woman named <b>Qian Yu</b>. The excitement is almost too much to handle. Tensions soar as the heroes arrive and discover all is not what it seems. (The precise motivation for being in Boat Bottom is up to the players themselves. See “Introduction.”)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">It turns out the mysterious Qian Yu has been watching the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PCs, and she’s impressed. She’s not a master thief but an archae- ologist who “stole” an Air Nomad artifact from the Sparrowkeet Air corporation. When repair workers found the remains of what looked like a small, abandoned spirit shrine with Air Nomad iconography buried under a Sparrowkeet Air factory, the corpo- ration asked Qian Yu and her team of experienced archaeologists to excavate the ruins for them. The CEO of Sparrowkeet, Yuzhen Sr., assured Qian Yu and her team that any artifacts they found would be preserved and returned to the Avatar. Yuzhen Sr. be- lieved they would find nothing...<b>But after the team uncovered a valuable artifact, Qian Yu learned Yuzhen Sr. intended to sell it to the highest bidder.</b>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Qian Yu needs the companions to help <b>deliver the artifact</b>
</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the Beifong Metalbending Academy outside Yu Dao<span class="p">. There, she hopes her former instructor, the legendary Metal- bender Toph Beifong, can get the artifacts into the right hands. Unfortunately, Sparrowkeet Air has Boat Bottom surrounded with their eyes peeled like eagle-hawks. This is where the PCs come in.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">With the PCs’ skills, Qian Yu might just be able to smuggle the artifact (the exact nature of which is decided by the players) to Toph after all. When the PCs accept this quest, escaping Boat Bottom is only the beginning of their trials. Along their journey escorting Qian Yu, the companions dodge cutthroat mercenar- ies, cross paths with a potential friend or foe, weave through treacherous mountain paths, and perhaps even come face-to- face with the leaders of Sparrowkeet Air.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs get to choose their own path through the Earth Kingdom, encountering new complications and locations as they travel. Some of the fun of the adventure is seeing which path the PCs will travel this time! But most likely, their journey will always culminate at the Beifong Metalbending Academy, where they will have one final confrontation with Sparrowkeet Air and their other pursuers.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Antagonists</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sparrowkeet Air has called upon many resources to find Qian Yu <span class="p">and there are a number of people looking for the arti- fact. The company has papered the area with numerous wanted posters (even air-dropping them from their dirigibles) offering a bounty for the first person (or group) to fund Qian Yu and bring her to the company. </span>Sparrowkeet Air plans to pay this bounty with a fraction of the money they make selling the artifact.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the heart of the chase are <b>Yuzhen Sr. </b>and <b>Yuzhen Jr.</b>, the owners of Sparrowkeet Air. Though their motivations differ</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for wanting the artifact, both men want it. Yuzhen Jr. sees the artifact as a means to an end—Sparrowkeet is close to going belly-up, and selling off a near-priceless Air Nomad artifact could be just the influx of cash his company needs to keep going and for him to keep paying his employees. Yuzhen Sr. feels the artifact belongs to him and his son because it was found on company land. He knows his company is in dire straits, but his main motivation is avarice. <b>The major difference between the two Yuzhens </b>is that the companions may be able to convince Yuzhen Jr. of their cause by offering an alternative to save his company. Yuzhen Sr., on the other hand, is set in his ways. De- pending on how your adventure plays out, son may turn against father, or vice versa.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sparrowkeet Air has blanketed the area with wanted posters and will pay whichever mercenary finds Qian Yu with a small portion of what the Yuzhens make off selling the artifact. <b>The two mercenary groups who picked up on the bounty are:</b>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>The Snow Rats</b>—A group of Southern Water Tribe mercenaries unfailingly loyal to their leader, Koa. The mercenaries act out of necessity to help their families back home and could be convinced to stop their hunt…if they’re presented with a better option.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>The Yu Dao Bounty Hunter’s Guild</b>—The guild members have seen the bounty and a group of them have joined forces to hunt for Qian Yu. Each of them is a skilled professional and is unlikely to give up their hunt unless there’s no more bounty or the risk ends up being higher than the reward.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The wildcard in this chase is the <b>inventor and architect Ume</b>, who heard about the bounty and is mostly curious about the Air Nomad artifact. She wants to find Qian Yu and inspect the artifact, but doesn’t necessarily want to collect the bounty. She’s interested in its artistry and wants to see if she can use it as inspiration for her newest designs. Depending on the situation, how the PCs treat her, and if the GM needs an escalation, Ume can help or hinder the companions on their quest.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Order of Things</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The group has a few days worth of (air) travel until they reach Beifong Metalbending Academy. <b>Qian Yu stole a dirigible from Sparrowkeet Air and parked it outside Boat Bottom</b>. The companions can use it to get to the academy. Without the dirigible it is nearly impossible to avoid capture; the antagonists are more mobile.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To get to their goal the companions need to: get out of Boat Bottom, get to the dirigible, get the dirigible running, and make a few stops along the way for supplies before arriving at the acade- my. <b>The players decide which locations they stop </b>at each time they need to refuel. The adventure is designed so that the compan- ions must stop and refill the oil tanks of the dirigible twice before reaching the academy, but you as the GM should add more or less stops based on the amount of time you have to play.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The companions travel from Boat Bottom to any location in the Plains, to any location in the Mountains, and then to Yu Dao. <span class="p">They might know of some of these locations in advance, based on their backgrounds, but they can spy all of them from a distance when flying or traveling—if it doesn’t make sense that the PCs know all about Ume’s Workshop in the plains, for ex- ample, they still can see the tents and structures there and make a decision about whether or not to visit that place. There is also one moving location: Sparrowkeet Air’s Flying HQ, which you can use as an optional location depending upon whether or not the Yuzhens catch up with the PCs’ dirigible.</span>
</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each location is a picturesque and fun set piece to throw antagonists in your PCs’ path. <span class="p">Plains and mountain locations each include a suggested escalation you can use to amp up the ac- tion for your players. If they don’t work based on the story you’re telling, you can also use the general escalations in “GM Advice.”</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Although those locations represent the key spots where interesting conflicts may arise, you should populate the areas between with locations and biomes as you see fit, depending on the story, the players’ preferences, and the time you have to play. The more interesting and complicated locations the PCs en-</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">counter, the longer your story will take to complete. So for one group of players, you might provide villages and towns where they can gather rumors, disguise themselves, and use connec- tions to negotiate safe havens, giving the PCs plenty of differ- ent threads to follow. For another group of players, you might provide forests, mountains, or even tunnels where they can use creative survival skills, face dangerous beasts, and enjoy the wilderness, overcoming a series of interesting obstacles before moving on to the next key location in relatively short order.</p>

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">What is the Artifact?</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Airbender artifact is something ancient, impressive, and of enormous value. <span class="p">But its exact form and nature is up to you and your players. When the PCs start the game, Qian Yu must be carrying the artifact on her. Until the PCs recover the artifact and return it to the archeologist, Qian Yu isn’t quite sure if she can trust the PCs and does her best to keep it hidden. But once it’s recovered, she may no longer be able to hide it, and the PCs can learn what it actually is.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At that point, the players help build the story by answering the questions below and creating the artifact together. This happens at the level of the players themselves—not at the level of the characters; these questions are for the players to answer in ways that create more fun for them, as opposed to questions that indicate actual knowledge their characters have.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the PCs first set eyes on the Air Nomad artifact, go around the table asking each player one or more of these questions:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What type of object is the artifact?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What is unique about the artifact that makes it rare and irreplaceable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What about the artifact makes it difficult to keep safe or conceal?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What is the most beautiful part of the artifact?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What historical meaning does the artifact hold?</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note: <span class="p">If your players prefer, open each question to the entire group and let them discuss. Some roleplayers are shy, unused</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to storytelling beyond their character, or don’t like being put on the spot! For an extra immersive flair, consider writing each question on a small slip of tea-stained paper, rolling it up, and tying it with twine. Distribute these tiny “Air Nomad scrolls” to the players to open and answer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">With these details established, be sure to shape the story around the players’ answers, so they know their storytelling has weight. If the artifact is an Air Nomad staff, how do they hide or disguise the tall object during their travels? If the artifact is an ancient guide to how to meditate into the Spirit World, where might they practice those techniques? Even seemingly small opportunities to incorporate the artifact details will delight the players. Everyone loves a good callback!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Culture and Yu Dao Town</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The details the players provide about the Air Nomad artifact establish it as rare, valuable, and sought after. But the import- ant characters with whom the players cross paths all have their own reasons they can benefit from this object of a nearly-lost civilization. For some, the allure is purely financial. For others, it is a dubious means to a well-meaning end. For yet others, it is a spark of knowledge and inspiration that could lead to new designs and creations to better the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The setting of this adventure is an appropriate backdrop for the themes of culture, its appropriation, and its appreciation. As the players find themselves amidst this battle for the Air Nomad artifact, they travel toward the town of Yu Dao, the oldest Fire Nation colony in the Earth Kingdom during the Hundred Year War. As a colony, Yu Dao allowed Earth Kingdom citizens to live freely among its Fire Nation citizens.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This created a blend of cultures in Yu Dao over many years, visible from its architecture to its metalwork artisanship (a combination of earthbending and firebending) to its families; indeed, Fire Nation immigrants married and started families with Earth Kingdom locals. After the Hundred Year War, the Yu Dao Resistance struggled against the Harmony Restoration Movement which sought to remove all Fire Nation colonies from Earth Kingdom territory, and after hard-fought battle and intense mediation, it was decided Yu Dao would govern under a new, multicultural coalition, a move that ultimately led to the creation of the United Republic of Nations much later.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, use the NPCs established in “Important Charac- ters” and escalations attached to sites in “Important Locations” to explore these themes with the players combining scenes of action and moral dilemma. You might even offer the players the option to negotiate between Sparrowkeet Air and Qian Yu at the end of the adventure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How It Ends</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assuming the companions make it to the Beifong Metalbending Academy, they will likely confront whatever antagonist is left chas- ing them right before or when they arrive. Along the way to the academy, the players have probably encountered multiple people who want the artifact, and some for very good reasons. How they decide to help these people later on or address their immediate concerns brings nuance to a rather straightforward chase.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Try to think of this adventure like an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. The adventure could end with <i>Yuzhen Jr. allying with the companions to take down Spar- rowkeet Air’s Flying HQ</i>, or the adventure could end with <i>the PCs defending the Beifong Metalbending Academy with its students as the Snow Rats infiltrate and look for Qian Yu! </i>Regardless, the end of the adventure should give the players a chance to feel special—and to feel that their actions made a real difference as they pull off a victory against the odds.</p>
