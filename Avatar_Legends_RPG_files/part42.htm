<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Korra Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom has experienced nonstop turmoil since the assassination of Queen Hou-Ting. King Wu currently governs the kingdom, though he intends to rule only for as long as necessary until the kingdom can successfully transition into a democratic nation. The monarchy is still important to many people within the Earth Kingdom, and if the recent events with the Earth Empire have taught the leaders of the Earth Kingdom anything, it’s that wide-scale change takes time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Since the kingdom is fresh off two dictatorships that exploit- ed the vulnerabilities of small villages contending with poverty and bandits, trust in authority figures is hard to come by. Life in its smaller villages has never been easy, and promises of safety usually come with ulterior motives. King Wu’s wish for democ- racy is a far cry from anything people in rural communities need at any given moment. Food and shelter are at the forefront of people’s minds; to that end, many people move from the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">countryside to the city in search of work. Unfortunately, many of these immigrants find larger city governments too overloaded to care for them and triads willing to take advantage of them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In Ba Sing Se, citizens must learn how to navigate life without the wall between the Lower and Middle Rings. While many who lived in the Lower Ring despised the wall, many in the Middle Ring enjoyed it, because they felt it improved their quality of life. Now the well-off are forced to mingle with the poor, and oppor- tunities to change one’s fortunes are there for anyone enterpris- ing enough to seize them. It’s an unprecedented time of integra- tion in Ba Sing Se, and it’s unlikely to be a smooth transition.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Wu</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A king ushering his kingdom into a new age of democracy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Wu is the 54<span class="s48">th </span>Earth Monarch. Young, privileged, and used to a life of comfort, Wu looked forward to taking the throne after his great aunt Hou-Ting’s assassination. Unfortunately, Kuvira spoke against his rise to power during his coronation and effectively usurped him. Since then, Wu has grown up a lot, though he still loves to break into song at inappropriate times. He is a gifted public speaker and knows how to both work up and calm a crowd. While he still has moments of shallow vanity, he is steadily learning more about what it means to govern. After trying to rush the process of turning the Earth Kingdom into a democracy, Wu understands that his people need time to adjust, and patience is a necessary part of leadership. Heroes who want to help Wu might volunteer to oversee elections in different re- gions of the Earth Kingdom and protect them from sabotage. As a public figure, Wu also needs constant protection from threats.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Suyin Beifong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A metalbending pioneer and the leader of Zaofu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part40.htm#bookmark98" class="s25">Suyin is the leader and founder of Zaofu, a city that’s home to many Earthbenders who can metalbend, collectively known as the Metal Clan. She is also the daughter of the famed Toph Beifong. Like her mother and sister, Lin (page 82),</a> Suyin is highly skilled in metalbending. She has five children, a passion for the arts, and takes a particular interest in dance. Unlike her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sister, Suyin is a cheerful free spirit and had an irresponsible and rebellious streak as a teenager. The two sisters did not get along when they were young because of this difference, but Suyin has matured since then.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Baatar Jr., Suyin’s son, was engaged to Kuvira until her defeat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Empire uprising and Gaoling Crisis both hit Suyin hard. She, along with the rest of the Metal Clan, have even less tolerance for aspiring military dictators now than ever before.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Toph Beifong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An elderly metalbending master who keeps getting pulled back into the fray</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Toph Beifong continued to help out Avatar Aang throughout</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">her adult life just as she had in her youth. After teaching metal- bending for a time, she settled in Republic City and served as its chief of police. Many decades have passed since then, and Toph spends much of her time in Foggy Swamp where she’d be enjoying the peace and quiet, if not for the world continually bothering her!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When Avatar Korra suffered from the effects of mercury poisoning, Toph aided her. When Suyin and her family were captured by the Earth Empire, Toph came to the rescue. After that, Korra and King Wu asked Toph to run for office in Gaol- ing…and she very reluctantly agreed to do so. The election was called off, but Toph helped resolve the overall crisis and is back in the swamp trying to find some peace once again. Heroes who want this metalbending master’s help will have a very tricky time convincing her to yet again come out of retirement.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a name="bookmark101">Kuvira</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A former dictator of a failed regime looking for redemption</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kuvira did a lot of damage when she tried to form the Earth Empire and is now eager to fix her mistakes. Kuvira only recently owned up to the full extent of the wrongs she committed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part39.htm#bookmark97" class="s25">Returning home to Zaofu was humbling for Kuvira and she was forced to face her ex-fiancée, Bataar Jr., whom she tried to kill with a spirit energy weapon. By acknowledging the people she hurt with her actions, Kuvira started down the road towards re- demption. Her genuine remorse and assistance ending the Earth Empire (page 81)</a> was enough that she is allowed to be under house arrest in Zaofu rather than prison.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kuvira is a skilled military leader and tactician. She’s smart, can think on her feet, and is willing to make tough calls for caus- es she believes in. While she may offer help in order to redeem herself further, trusting her is not a simple matter. Even if her intentions are honest, plenty of people don’t believe she has the right to redemption. If King Wu, Suyin Beifong, and the Avatar all agree to send her on a mission, they will likely assign people to watch her carefully. This job also necessarily includes prevent- ing angry civilians from trying to assassinate her if they see her out in the world.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brainwashing Technology</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Extremism Born of Fear</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part39.htm#bookmark97" class="s25">A scientist named Dr. Sheng developed advanced brainwashing methods for Commander Guan’s (page 81)</a> use. While its ef- fects have been negated in Gaoling, it is still at risk of being used elsewhere by anyone who had a chance to investigate or steal the technology. Well-meaning, enterprising inventors may research the technology trying to see if it has practical uses in society, beyond mass population control. However, it is a slippery slope experimenting with such destructive technology and the effects could be disastrous.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those brainwashed during the Gaoling Crisis may experience possible unpredictable side effects in the future. Should rumors spread of odd behavior somewhere in the Earth Kingdom, King Wu or Suyin might send heroes to the source to determine whether brainwashing plays a role. Otherwise, heroes might find that an enemy is truly being controlled by someone else through brainwashing.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shift to Democracy</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Wu intends to abolish the Earth Kingdom monarchy, but it’s a slow process since not everyone in the kingdom is ready for it. No two states in the Earth Kingdom are identical, so it is hard to say how any one of them will react to the news of a potential election. Each state has been tasked by Wu with holding their own elections, but may do so on their own time table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many rural inhabitants are so busy focused on trying to find their next meal that democracy seems like a distant concept.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corrupt local politicians who are currently in power capitalize on the rampant poverty by feeding their citizens lies about hold- ing elections, placing the blame on the Earth King. It may seem like King Wu is shifting his responsibilities to care for his people onto someone else. Heroes may need to protect people running for office, and in especially tough situations, they may need to convince potential candidates to run at all.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earth Empire Loyalists</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Extremism Born of Fear</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some still believe the United Republic of Nations should belong to the Earth Kingdom, and that the kingdom is no place for people from other nations. It is a strange time to be living in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Earth Kingdom if you or your family are multicultural or originally from one of the other nations. The nation is the most blended it has ever been, but Earth Kingdom fundamentalists threaten the established diversity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since there were two attempted uprisings back-to-back, it isn’t hard to imagine more taking place in the future. The Gaoling Cri- sis is not the last time nationalism inspires a harmful movement in the Earth Kingdom, and some regions might inch closer to a civil war. If the heroes are lucky and clever, they might stop a disaster from blowing up in the first place. Otherwise, they may have to navigate another uprising as they pursue their goals.</p>
