<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Roku Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads of the Roku Era are influential and their teach- ings have spread far and wide. Much of this is due to the direct support and involvement of the political families within the Fire Nation. This relationship is being celebrated with the construc- tion of a Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning in the Fire Nation, made possible through the funding and management of Fire Nation nobility. The construction of this center is a divisive issue, and a small school of Air Nomads called the Guiding Wind, led by the popular philosopher Khandro, speaks out against its construc- tion and demands an end to Air Nomad affiliation with any nation’s ruling classes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Guiding Wind is a small order, not officially recognized by</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25">the Four Temples of the Air Nomads. They want autonomy over both their physical and spiritual life and aim to undermine the controlling power of elites. Avatar Roku often calls on the Air No- mads to aid other nations, but the Guiding Wind refuses on the grounds he is overstepping by asking that they involve themselves in politics. In contrast, most Air Nomad temples gladly help when Roku calls, not only in the border dispute between the Earth Kingdom and Northern Water Tribe (page 46),</a> but in natural disasters like the earthquakes in the east of the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Master Youdron continues to support the Air Nomads’ re- lationship with the Avatar and with elites of all nations as a way to help the world and reach more people. The conflict between Youdron’s perspective and that of the upstart Guiding Wind has sparked an internal discourse within the Air Nomads on wheth- er they should turn more inwards as the Guiding Wind suggests, or continue to help the rest of the world where they can. Part of this tension comes from whether or not the Air Nomads should embrace those with lots of worldly prosperity (like the nobility) or reject them and any trappings of wealth altogether, because working with other nations means also working with those unwilling to cede power or wealth.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Youdron</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An elder who opposes the Guiding Wind</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Master Youdron is an elderly airbending monk and an Air No- mad Elder. As a representative of the Air Nomads, he stands in opposition to Khandro and his teachings. Youdron believes the Air Nomads should work with the Avatar and the other nations to reach more people and help the world. He accepts that deal- ing with the elites is a means to that end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Youdron, a cautious man, knows of the danger the Fire Nation poses to his people should they cross the Fire Lord. As a precaution, Youdron has begun transcribing some of their</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">most sacred practices into coded texts and hiding them in places around the Four Nations. Youdron is pulled in many different directions in his old age, and as the Guiding Wind movement gains popularity he could use help in his secret mission.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Khandro</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A devout Air Nomad and popular philosopher</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part27.htm#bookmark73" class="s25">Khandro is the charismatic and ambitious head of the Guiding Wind movement; he argues that the relationship between the Air Nomads and the nobility of the world has impeded the spir- itual growth of people across all nations. Khandro truly believes that the ideals of the Guiding Wind will help him and his people reach spiritual enlightenment and that marrying Zeisan (page 48),</a> the sister of the Fire Lord, will help him destabilize the nobility structures in the Fire Nation. Khandro has an abiding respect for Zeisan and what she is willing to do to unravel the corruption in her country. For their plan to work he must marry the princess—against the advice of his most loyal acolytes—and risk incurring the wrath of the Fire Lord.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Currently, Khandro is recruiting members of the Air Nomad</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">temples to his cause. Those who feel they’re being spread too thin or worry about the nobility’s influence have embraced his teachings. Khandro can be a powerful ally to those looking to topple Fire Nation nobility if they can prove they believe in the Guiding Wind’s ideals.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rioshon</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A chi-blocking Air Nun famed for her martial prowess</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rioshon is a skilled Airbender and chi-blocker from the Western Air Temple, sought the world over for her martial skills. She’s serious, intelligent, and speaks honestly in most situations, even if it means angering people. The nun only teaches students she is absolutely sure will only use the attained knowledge for princi- ples adhering to traditional Air Nomad philosophy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One such student was Princess Zeisan, who Rioshon taught to chi-block. Over the course of their training together, Rioshon and Zeisan fell in love, but never publicly acknowledged it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rioshon has heard rumors that Princess Zeisan’s rejection of her family has angered Fire Lord Sozin. She now worries harm may befall the princess, and she might have to step in to help Zeisan, despite swearing to stay apart in fear that Sozin might discover their love for each other and use it against his sister.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyatso</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Master Airbender and friend of Avatar Roku</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyatso, a young, friendly, goofy monk of the Southern Air Temple, just became a master Airbender. He’s good friends with Avatar Roku, who often comes to Gyatso for practical advice or for a fresh perspective when he’s feeling dour. Gyatso remains neutral in the conflicts and internal debate about whether the Air Nomads should become more isolationist or continue embracing the world. He believes diversity amongst his people is a good thing and internal debate eventually leads to fruitful progress no matter the decision. To that end, he encourages the temples to discuss and debate one another in the spirit of com- promise. Anyone who wants a level head in disputes can find no finer monk than Gyatso. He manages to effortlessly work levity into difficult situations yet takes everyone’s feelings seriously.</p>

<a name="bookmark76">Norri</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A young Air Nomad with a strong bond to sky bison</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sister Norri is a young Air Nomad student who shepherds the sky bison near the Western Air Temple. She’s fun-loving, knows all there is to know about bison, and likes to cause a little bit of chaos for her mentors. Norri’s dedication to the bison has inter- fered many times with her gaining her master tattoos. While she cares for the spiritual teachings of her people, she’s not overly bothered with mastering airbending and is constantly distracted by any number of matters concerning sky bison. Recently, she and her bison companion, Swish, have been tasked with a secret mission by master Youdron to hide sacred Air Nomad artifacts. She’s in over her head, has never been so far from her temple, and could use a bit of help!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anada</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A brilliant engineer adopted by the Air Nomads</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sister Anada is an engineer whose innovative designs created the Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning. Anada was orphaned in the Fire Nation and cared for by her grandmother as a baby, but when her grandmother couldn’t care for a child any longer, she gave her over to be raised by the Air Nomads as a nun.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Anada can’t bend, a rarity in Air Nomad society, but her skills earned her the opportunity to return to the Fire Nation and reunite with her beloved grandmother. She happily accepted that chance, but things aren’t turning out as planned. Work on the center has halted due to the Guiding Wind’s interference and the Fire Nation military guard seizing control of the site. Anada and the other Air Nomads need help untangling this situation before it escalates.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eastern Air Temple</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked themes: Resources and Industrialization</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In order to fund a number of infrastructure advancements in the Earth Kingdom, the eastern states strip-mine the mountains in the region near the Eastern Air Temple. Having little need for the resources, the Air Nomads of the temple did little to stop the miners, until they dug so deep into the mountains they angered a local spirit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The giant spirit, called Stone Dreamer, shaped like a gigantic canyon crawler with hundreds of legs, was a sleepy, peaceful spirit despite its appearance. It slumbered near the Eastern Tem- ple because it enjoyed the quiet, but when the miners disrupted its home—even after being warned by the Air Nomads—it went on a rampage, destroying equipment and threatening towns. The Council of Elders at the Eastern Temple debate whether or not they should step in to help—doesn’t the spirit have a right to protect its home?</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nobility &amp; the Guiding Wind</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Some may find the idea of the Guiding Wind ac- cepting Fire Nation, Earth Kingdom, or even Water Tribe nobility into their ranks perplexing. What’s im- portant to remember is the young nobles who join the Guiding Wind are rebels just like the movement. They’re the ultimate fist in the face to the ideal of nobility, because these youths gave up their wealth and power for enlightenment, whereas the nobles supporting the Fire &amp; Air Center of Learning did not. Khandro gladly welcomes any nobles into his order who adhere to its ideals.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guiding Wind</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Testing Alliances</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Guiding Wind, led by Monk Khandro, is a renegade order of Air Nomads, not officially recognized by any of the four temples. The Eastern Air Temple views them as too disruptive, the North as too extreme, and the West as too in opposition to tradition. The South has yet to take an official stance. Khandro happily criticizes every temple, believing every Council of Elders lazy at best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One element that worries Khandro about his movement is the string of violent acts supposedly perpetrated by members of his order in the Fire Nation. Violent acts aren’t in line with the Guiding Wind’s principles, let alone those of the Air Nomads as a whole. Khandro can’t trace the reports to any known members. He is left to wonder—if the Air Nomads aren’t perpetrating violence in the name of the Guiding Wind…who would do such a thing and why? Maybe the Fire Lord’s supporters have an idea.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Holding Things Together</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Resources and Industrialization</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Working together with Avatar Roku, the Air Nomads are spread across the world helping to keep peace in the various nations. They’re diplomats, spiritual advisors, and even martial defenders when needed. Most Air Nomads don’t have time to engage in the philosophical discussions on the nature of their order that the Council of Elders and various Air Nomad philosophers do—they’re out in the world doing things, instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many Airbenders recognize they’re starting to be worn thin. While they have enough Air Nomads to fulfill their duties for now, the temples can sometimes be near-empty as members rush out to deal with one disaster or the next. The idea that any- one would mount a full-scale attack on the peaceful Air Nomads is inconceivable…and yet some Air Nomads have become aware that if an all-out attack came, they would have trouble mustering enough strength in one place to stop the attackers.</p>
