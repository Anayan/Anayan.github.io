<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each game of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is a conversa- tion going back and forth between the many players, including the GM. Sometimes, when it’s your turn (as the GM) to speak, you have what you say next dictated by a player-facing move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a PC <span class="s11">relies on their skills and training</span>, you follow the move’s results, replying according to the rules of that move and the result the player rolled on their dice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But sometimes it’s your turn to speak without any player-facing move to guide you. Then, you need to say something to carry the story forward. When you do this, you are making a GM move: a specific, individual action you as GM take to keep things moving.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">When to Make Your Move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can make a GM move whenever you like—whenever it feels appropriate—but you should almost always make one when:</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">A player rolls a miss</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Missing on a dice roll is the perfect moment to make a GM move and complicate the story. Use what’s happening in the story at the moment to decide what kind of move to make.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, if a PC misses when trying to <span class="s11">rely on their skills and training </span>by waterbending a defensive shield for an ally, you could use the GM move <span class="s23">threaten someone </span>and narrate how a misplaced jet of water accidentally hurls the ally into the middle of the fight.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">There’s a lull in the action</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If your session slows, when no one knows what to say next, or you feel that the PCs have had enough downtime, make a GM move to kickstart the action. In these situations, your moves don’t have to be brutal; they just have to add excitement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, if the companions have spent all day going over the information they have in a teahouse but don’t really know where to go from there, you might use the <span class="s23">offer a risky oppor- tunity </span>GM move and have a Triple Threat Triad leader approach them with a deal.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A player grants you a golden opportunity <span class="p">Sometimes, a PC might say something or do something that feels like the perfect opportunity to make a GM move. Use these mo- ments to emphasize the effects and consequences of their choices.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">For example, when a PC, faced with a deadly duel on a roof- top, decides to simply jump off the roof to escape, they have of- fered up a golden opportunity to <span class="s23">inflict fatigue or a condition </span>(how much depends on where they land!). For a more subtle example, when an Idealist decides to let the starving bandits go after a long discussion about right and wrong, you might decide to <span class="s23">shift their balance </span>and move them towards Forgiveness on the balance track. It’s the perfect opportunity!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part48.htm#bookmark111" class="s25">In particular, PCs often have to take drastic action in order to clear their conditions (page 101).</a> Treat these moments as easy “golden opportunities”—when a PC “takes foolhardy action without talking to their companions,” they’re setting themselves up for a GM move.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Soft and Hard Moves</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you make a GM move, you can either signal what you’re about to do and allow a player to act before it happens—making a “softer” move that’s preventable—or you can deliver a move immediately without warning— a “harder” move that hits where it hurts. Think of “soft” and “hard” as two ends of a spectrum of how much players can react to prevent the consequences—any given move can be made at many places on that spectrum.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, here are three different forms of the <span class="s23">threaten someone </span>move:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Telling a player that the beams of the burning building creak ominously as they burst in to save someone is a pretty soft version of the move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Telling a player that they hear a crash as the beams begin to tumble down is a harder version of the move. The PC now has to react to this threat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Telling a player that the burning beams come crashing down around them, trapping them in the room and inflicting multiple points of fatigue on them is a very hard version of the move—the character not only took a hit, but must now deal with a worse situation.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Think about the dramatic stakes of making a move soft or hard. Soft moves imply a manageable or subtle threat. Hard moves show that a threat is dangerous and overt. For example, an enemy who arrives and immediately inflicts a condition while shooting lightning at a PC shows a much greater danger than one posturing with fingers crackling with sparks. You can also use the texture of your moves as a pacing mechanism. If the game gets a little slow and you need to up the tension, you can start making increasingly hard moves. On the other hand, if the companions have been taking a great deal of fatigue and condi- tions, soften your moves in order to prevent it all from becoming a little overwhelming.</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Inflict fatigue or a condition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the companions do something taxing or get hurt in some way, this is the easiest move to use: just assign some fatigue or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a condition. The fiction around this move can vary a lot, but always remember to put the fiction first by describing the situa- tion—“You tumble off the boat into the cold water”—before you start telling players to mark fatigue or conditions. You’ve got to create a compelling world, and that means making sure that each fatigue or condition marked is tied back to the fiction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Use your judgement as to how much to inflict, <span class="s23">but remem- ber that a condition is approximately equivalent to 2-fatigue</span>. A punch-in-the-face from a random guard is probably worth</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1-fatigue, but an angry screaming fit with one’s cantankerous father-in-law might be worth a whole condition. Remember that inflicting fatigue is generally softer than inflicting conditions— fatigue is easier to get rid of without consequence—and the more of either you inflict, the harder of a move you’re making.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This is a good move to effectively assign a “cost” to certain actions. An Earthbender who runs through a flaming building might be <span class="s11">pushing their luck</span>, but if you’ve established the inferno is enormous, you might just inflict fatigue before the roll to represent the danger. This move also helps you represent the fiction mechanically—a Waterbender who falls from the top of a building, barely arresting their fall by hitting canopies on the way down, should suffer some fatigue or conditions. Otherwise, that fall feels unrealistic. Players don’t have any incentive to avoid or mitigate danger unless those threats have a cost!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A PC rushes through the smoke-filled corridor of a burning building; the GM tells them to mark 2-fatigue.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A PC falls off a roof and onto the awning of a fruit stand; the GM tells them to mark a condition.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A PC spends the day taking care of a group of energetic children; the GM tells them to mark 1-fatigue.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Reveal a hidden truth</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Want to add drama to a scene? Reveal new information! While this can be a truth about a scheme or plot you’ve had in mind for a while, you can also create a new, explosive truth on the spot. You didn’t have to know that a PC’s masked foe was secretly their mother in disguise before you reveal it! Fill in mysteries with a rewarding and dramatic answer for the moment; you don’t have to commit in ad- vance to an answer that ends up making little sense in the moment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When improvising this way, ensure that the new information fits your fiction. You may not have had the new truth in mind until this moment, but when you introduce it into the fiction, it becomes part of your story’s overarching world. Don’t strain believability and continuity solely for drama. When you reveal the face beneath that mask, you reveal this person has been underneath the mask the whole time. You can reveal new truths—actually, multiple people wore the mask—but the more you reveal to explain other truths, the less likely the moment lands. It’s one thing if the face revealed</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is a PC’s mother, recontextualizing everything that everyone knew about her; it’s another thing if the mask is lifted to reveal a PC’s secret twin no one knew existed before this very moment.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A PC successfully <b>assesses a situation </b>by scoping out a temple they’re trying to infiltrate; when they examine the artwork, they see a story describing a difficult truth about their people’s past.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A PC spends some time cooling off and hanging out at a tea shop; they then spy a foe emerging from a door to the backroom, and realize this very tea shop hides a triad headquarters!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• A PC fails to catch a thief as he tries to get away; when he turns back with a grin, the PC sees the face of their long-lost sibling!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Shift their balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes the companions might do things that lead you to shift their balance directly—a hard move! But usually NPCs attempt to <span class="s23">shift a PC’s balance </span>when they interact with the PCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes, that means the NPC shifts their balance directly; other times, it means the NPC <span class="s11">calls the PC out </span>instead. <span class="s11">Call-</span>
</p>
<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing someone out <span class="p">is more about getting a character to act, while directly shifting balance suggests the NPC’s words affect the PC’s self-conception. An old man pleading for the companions to stop fighting because they’re destroying the village is </span>calling someone out<span class="p">, while the same old man scolding them for destroying the village after the fight is shifting their balance. Remember PCs can always try to </span>resist an NPC shifting their balance<span class="p">!</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Because balance is so internal (and often personal to players), a good technique is to ask the players what they think: “This seems to me like you’re moving towards Tradition…what do you think?”</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Guardian agrees to the very risky plan put forth by a rebel cap- tain; the GM tells them to shift their balance toward Trust.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Hammer takes a wounded villager to safety instead of fighting soldiers, who jeer and call them cowardly; the GM tells them the soldiers are trying to shift their balance toward Force.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Idealist shows mercy to a band of criminals, who thank the PC; the GM tells them the grateful criminals are trying to shift the Idealist’s balance toward Forgiveness.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Twist loyalties with tempting offers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions often think they know who’s good and who’s bad. This move complicates that belief. Give the companions reasons to side with enemies and reasons to doubt their allies. Maybe their allies use shady means to achieve their goals and ask the PCs to participate? Maybe their enemies want the same thing as the companions (for now…) and ask for their help? Ei- ther way, remind them that nothing is simple in the Avatarverse!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The easiest way to twist loyalties like this is with tempting offers, offers that are a little suspect but carry seductive rewards. Use these to entice the PCs into reconsidering their loyalties and to induce NPCs to change their minds and their sides in a conflict. A tempting offer put forward by a foe might imbalance an ally and change them from a friend to a dire threat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Remember, there’s no “true evil.” Even if you know how your players respond to temptation, giving them choices like this is a fun way of letting PCs double down on (or explore) their beliefs and drives. In turn, the offer has to actually be tempting, so valu- able they can’t look away, and not so vile they know it’s a trap.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions successfully <b>guide and comfort </b>an anti-bending rioter; he offers to help free their friend if they join the cause.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The identity of a mastermind is revealed to be the Icon’s bending master; that teacher offers to keep training the Icon if they help her accomplish a specific goal.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions wait and watch before launching an attack; while watching, they witness all the positive things their enemies actually do for the community.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Escalate to violence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Eventually, a fight is going to break out. Combat isn’t the be-all and end-all of this game, but the PCs are all competent fighters with advanced techniques, and at some point or another a cool action scene is due. Set one off when appropriate!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Consider carefully when to make NPCs resort to violence; while potent (and often exciting), this is an easy move to overuse. Does an NPC’s balance principle suggest it or did they just tip over on their balance track? Have the companions committed some grave act or offered a heinous insult? Does it add to the story’s drama for a fight to occur <i>right now</i>? Make violence mean something.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you use this as a harder move, you might inflict fatigue before the PCs react or begin a combat exchange, to show that their foes score a surprise hit, or that they’re prepared or skilled in some way. And remember, violence doesn’t necessarily mean a combat exchange—sometimes, violence can be resolved when the PCs <span class="s11">rely on their skills and training</span>
<a href="part55.htm#bookmark142" class="s25">, but the important idea is that the situation still escalated (see more on page 133).</a>

<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• The companions insult someone; the insulted party lets out a roar and throws a punch.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• A PC misses a roll while trying to sneak through the palace; they run headfirst into an elite guard who firebends a wall of flame to cut off any escape, then settles into a stance to fight them.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• The companions steal something from a local shop; the shopkeeper chases them into the street and incites the crowd against the PCs.</p>

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Offer a risky or costly opportunity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the companions are stuck on how to move forward, offer them risky or costly opportunities to get what they want. Show them a path to reach their goals (maybe through an NPC’s offer or through a flash of insight), but make it a dangerous path. The idea isn’t to demand PCs take that path—they might not choose if the path is too dangerous or isn’t worth it to them! But any such offer always pushes the conversation forward productively, even if the players turn down the offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This move is very useful when players miss on a move but you’d like to keep the action moving forward: give them another (similar) opportunity with a risk attached. The risk can even be another (harder) GM move, such as an escalation to violence, some fatigue, or a shift in balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Pay attention to risk versus cost. Risk means the penalty (whatever it may be) is uncertain. A cost implies that a penalty must be paid in order to take the action. Players treat decisions differently depending on whether there’s a risk or a cost associat- ed. Change it up from time to time!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions miss their roll <b>pleading </b>with a sentinel to let them through; but they do spot a trap-filled tunnel leading in the same direction.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions are at a loss for how to undermine the charismatic cult-leader; but they do connect with one cultist willing to work with them to steal the cult-leader’s sacred stone.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions see an enemy politician make a mistake and can use it to make a fool of him entirely; but doing so could cause a balance shift in some of them.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Threaten someone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can always make a move to put someone in a terrible position—a situation in which they have to react immediately or face some harm. It’s easy to do this for PCs; when they get spotted by the guards, you’ve threatened that PC. But you can threaten NPCs as well, putting them into spots that demand ac-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tion from the PCs. Every playbook pushes players to create some NPCs they care about. Put those loved ones in danger to raise the stakes and the tension. Maybe they get captured, thrown in front of an attack, or even threatened with emotional pain (like breakups, family feuds, or utter despair). Similarly, threatening innocent bystanders is a great way to push heroic PCs to action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Don’t be timid with this move; threatening a PC directly de- mands action, and threatening existing NPCs by bringing them into new situations might take the story in surprising directions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That said, players tend to fall in love with NPCs quickly. Even a character introduced earlier in that session can make a good</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">candidate for this move. As long as the players have decided that they care—and as heroes, they should care about nearly any innocent person suddenly thrust into danger! Look for opportu- nities to build those characters up, bolster their relationship with the PCs, and ultimately threaten it in dramatic moments!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions infiltrate an enemy legion; there, they spot a cap- tive whom they recognize as a friend from a couple sessions prior.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions are defeated in a fight; their foes ignore the com- panions and use the opportunity to capture someone the PCs were defending.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions finish lazing about in the forest for a while; as they clean up, they see glowing eyes looking at them from the treeline.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Shift the odds, suddenly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the action becomes predictable, twist the situation into something surprising and new. Whoever was losing might find a sudden, powerful advantage! An unseen trap might be sprung! An important NPC might appear and change everything! When you shift the odds in such a way, emphasize circumstances outside the companions’ control. Avoid saying something like “You slip and fall!” Instead, say, “The stone under your feet begins to crack…”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Think of this move as injecting excitement. As long as the play- ers still have a chance to respond, then a shift of the odds against them can be fun. Revealing that their foe actually has forces spread out, ready to ambush the PCs is fun and exciting—as long as it doesn’t happen every time or leave the PCs without options.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The “suddenly” in this move means that you don’t have to preface the move much. You still need it to make sense within the fiction, but this move represents traps, ambushes, and surprising new events. If the PCs are sitting pretty, thinking they’re in com- mand of the situation, this move perfectly upsets the cabbage cart!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• A PC misses a roll while attempting to infiltrate an enemy fortress; they slip inside, only to wind up in an ambush laid by a nemesis!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• The companions joke that convincing a tiny rogue band of bandits to surrender will be easy; when confronted, they discover the ban- dits have some kind of powerful spirit aiding them!</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• The companions handily defeat a foe; upon their enemy falling un- conscious, however, their enemy’s allies swarm down a hill to attack!</p>

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Exploit a weakness in their history</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A PC’s backstory is fertile ground in which to find story seeds. The backgrounds players pick for their companions are rich sources of inspiration! Maybe a PC’s past comes back to haunt them? Maybe the fact that they were in the military makes them unpleasant in the eyes of certain NPCs? Or maybe an old friend just needs help?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each playbook is also designed to tell a certain kind of story arc, and you’re encouraged to dig through them for inspiration. The Idealist’s code, the Successor’s lineage, the Hammer’s adver- sary—bring these all into play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This move covers everything from having an existing NPC recognize a PC from the same background, to introducing one of the PC’s mentors, to playing up an old rivalry—just so long as it complicates their story now. But similarly, this move also cov- ers emphasizing the limits of skill and knowledge the PCs might have garnered from their history. A Rogue with the Outlaw and Urban backgrounds may have no knowledge whatsoever of how to contend with a fancy dress party—and in fact, might have had a run-in with someone who recognizes them in a bad way, like the rich merchant they robbed!</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Example golden opportunities and moves:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The companions just defeated an enemy when the Successor’s father arrives to take their foe into custody.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Rogue goes to the local constabulary for help, only to find out that the officers recognize them as a thief and outlaw.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Idealist goes to seek advice from the leader of a local village, but the leader turns out to be the same person who once perpetrat- ed the tragedy that defines the Idealist.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Minor NPCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are side characters of low importance to the episode or overall story. Think of the shopkeeper whose produce is stolen from the bazaar, a guard who bars the way, an onlooker at the fair who makes an admiring comment about the companions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Minor NPCs may be named, but just as easily could go un- named. They tend to have rather basic capabilities and if they have combat training, tend to use only the most straightforward tactics:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Earthbenders hurl rocks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Firebenders throw gouts of flame.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Airbenders harness big gusts of wind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Waterbenders channel big jets of water.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Weapons users come swinging in with regular weapons.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Technologists apply obviously dangerous machines (harpoon guns, big tanks).</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do note that players often love to “adopt” minor NPCs and elevate them into positions of importance. If players show a par- ticular interest in a throwaway character, it might be time to up- grade them into a major NPC. Just give them a principle, expand their balance and fatigue tracks, add a few more conditions, and add a few advanced techniques if they have combat training!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fights with minor NPCs might not even need to involve exchanges of techniques. A simple roll of a basic move—some- thing like <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training</span>—will often do. Fights where the outcome is certain—the companions will absolutely win, for instance—don’t trigger a move at all. Most often, when an NPC doesn’t have any kind of combat training, there’s no un- certainty and no need for a move to be triggered; the PC might sweep them aside with a gust of wind or jet of water without even making a move.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Minor NPCs often don’t need fatigue, conditions, or balance, especially if they lack combat training. If they do need to be able to participate in combat, give them three fatigue, one condition, and a 0 to +1 balance track.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• Minor NPCs often don’t need a principle—they’re too minor to believe strongly in something—but if necessary, give them something broad or simple like Tradition or Loyalty.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">• Similarly, minor NPCs don’t need advanced techniques.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major NPCs are important to the current episode or overall story: the information broker who knows where the gang is, the guide who helps the companions through the desert, the owner of the tea shop the companions repeatedly return to.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Give them a name or title (the “Best of the Yuyan Archers,” for example), and at least one interesting physical feature, mannerism, or item of clothing (a scar, a stammer, or a vivid purple cloak, for instance). If you find that a minor NPC starts to appear in multiple episodes, it’s a good idea to start thinking of them as a major NPC!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Major NPCs are usually pretty capable and canny. If they’re combatants, they might have their own styles and distinctive visuals:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Earthbenders might hurl rocks, change the environment, or exhibit seismic sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• Firebenders might throw gouts of flame, light the environment aflame, or launch themselves into the air using fire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Airbenders might harness big gusts of wind, throw incoming physical attacks off-course with wind, or glide along on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">air currents or balls of whirling air (“air scooters”).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Waterbenders might channel big jets of water, use ice creatively to shape the environment, or heal (though this is rare).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Weapons users might come swinging in, dance around acrobatically, or attack with strength and power.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Their weapons might be showier or more exotic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Technologists have a few tricks, surprise weapons, and unexpected capabilities to deploy—but only a few.</p>
