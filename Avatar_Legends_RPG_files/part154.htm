</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometime in the morning, before the final match of the Spring Pro-Bending Tournament Qualifier, <b>First Gentleman Varrick </b>took a break from the Presidential Box to stretch his legs (his exact words: “I’m going to go stretch my legs!”). He never re- turned. His security searched the area but found no trace of the First Gentleman. Rather than alarm the citizenry, they took the matter to <b>President Moon</b>.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Varrick has been kidnapped by San Ho<span class="p">, a mysterious businessman in Republic City with a vendetta against Varrick and </span>Wakkanai<span class="p">—a Southern Water Tribe business magnate and inventor. San Ho believes he was betrayed by Varrick and Wakkanai years ago—that they conspired to ruin him. He has</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">built himself up ever since, becoming a newly powerful magnate with money to spend on his vendetta and the <b>Terra Triad </b>to carry out his will. He intends to use his criminal connections and wealth to destroy Wakkanai’s fortunes and end Varrick, all in one fell swoop…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wakkanai’s treatment centers are overseen by the Republic City Utilities Commission, a panel of three bureaucrats who hold her—and other public utility providers—accountable for their work. San Ho’s extraordinary wealth enabled him to throw lawyers at the Utilities Commission until they agreed to review safety issues at the facilities.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wakkanai’s review by the commission is going poorly: <span class="p">San Ho has bribed one of the three commissioners in charge of overseeing the water treatment rights, and he’s close to persuad- ing a second commissioner that Wakkanai hasn’t been adequate- ly maintaining the facilities. He’s sure that the upcoming vote on the safety issues his lawyers have raised will go his way, espe- cially once </span>he sabotages one of the older treatment centers, causing an explosion similar to the one that disgraced him all those years ago<span class="p">. And if Varrick just happens to be in the building when the explosion happens…all the better.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Initially, the companions are sent by President Moon to find her husband, but through their investigation they discover San Ho’s ploy, drawing them into a story of politics and intrigue!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Saving Varrick is only one small part of the issues the heroes could unravel here and there are many directions their adventure could take. To understand how your adventure unfolds, it’s first important to learn the history between Varrick, Wakkanai, and San Ho.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Past Misdeeds</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">San Ho was not always known by that name; decades ago, he was Yinuo, a fellow inventor and close friend of Wakkanai<span class="p">. Yinou and Wakkanai met in Republic City. At first, they were rivals and competing inventors. But as they learned from each other’s work and their competition drove them to greater and greater heights of invention, soon enough they realized that they were stronger together than apart. Though they sometimes frus- trated each other, their relationship developed into a partnership devoted to building new ways of helping the city and its people. Working together, </span>they discovered a new method for desali- nating the water around Republic City<span class="p">, potentially meeting the needs of the millions of people flocking to the bustling metropolis with an all-new water treatment facility.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But Yinuo and Wakkanai lacked the experience and funds to execute this idea at a massive scale and sell it to the city. Yinuo wanted to expand their operation without help, but Wakkanai thought it was safer to turn to outside investors, like the young Iknik Blackstone Varrick. The two inventors grew apart as they tried to find a path forward, each pursuing their own solutions and becoming increasingly distrustful of the other.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Stunned by the potential of the technology, Varrick was eager to invest…but when he learned that Wakkanai’s partner opposed his involvement, Varrick also became eager to get rid of Yinuo. While Wakkanai went looking for more investors, <b>Varrick tampered with one of Yinuo’s experiments, causing an explosion to “prove” Yinuo’s methods were dangerous</b>. Varrick seized the moment to present “evidence” that Yinuo’s negligent experiments endangered everyone. Yinuo instantly recognized that the evidence was false, but Wakkanai had al- ready begun to mistrust Yinuo and refused to listen to him. The idea that he had become reckless fit only too well with the story she told herself; she believed Varrick over her former partner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">City regulators barred Yinuo from doing any further research and ordered him divested from the startup he had founded with Wakkanai. Once Yinuo was out of the picture, Varrick helped Wakkanai negotiate a profitable arrangement with the city. Wak- kanai took on responsibility for managing the treatment centers in exchange for generational rights to their profits; <b>if Wakkanai dies, the rights pass to her daughter, Kiaanii, rather than back to the city</b>. Varrick was proud to have negotiated the deal; he ensured that Wakkanai—a good Southern Water Tribe citi- zen!—would be able to keep the business safely in the family!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wakkanai has spent the last twenty years maintaining the treatment centers and working with the city government. Yinuo, unable to find work in Republic City, was forced to return to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Earth Kingdom; he changed his name to San Ho and began working for the only people who would hire him after he was disgraced—criminals, warlords, and thieves. While Wakkanai refused to gouge the city even in times of great need, San Ho profited from technology he sold to the highest bidder, no mat- ter how they used it.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Corruption of the Commissioners</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While San Ho is prepared to kill Varrick, he doesn’t want to physically hurt Wakkanai—he wants her to survive, powerless to prevent her empire from being dismantled. In order to do that, he needs to find some way to legally strip her of her rights, but even killing her wouldn’t accomplish that goal. Her holdings would simply go to her daughter, and Wakkanai wouldn’t be around to see her businesses crumble.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Instead, San Ho hired lawyers to ensure that Wakkanai’s rights are legally removed—all it will take is getting two of the three commissioners to agree that she’s not fit to continue on the job—and he’s brought in Terra Triad thugs to sabotage the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">plants. While Wakkanai scrambles to figure out how safety issues at her sites have been compromised, San Ho’s lawyers inch ever closer to their goal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The three commissioners have radically different attitudes toward the case:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Commissioner Chao </b>is firmly against Wakkanai keeping the rights; she’s been bribed by San Ho into openly supporting his campaign to take over the water</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">treatment centers and takes every opportunity to disparage Wakkanai in service of her corrupt benefactor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Commissioner Ke Xin </b>doesn’t take bribes—San Ho asked around before offering him yuan—but he is very concerned about the safety incidents at Wakkanai’s sites.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So far, he has believed Wakkanai’s lawyers when they’ve promised that the sites are safe, but another incident is likely to push him toward awarding the rights to a new manager.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Commissioner Gajii </b>is also above bribes, but her long-standing relationship with Wakkanai meant that San Ho didn’t even try to persuade her to support him. He knows she’s not going to turn on Wakkanai, even if offered briefcases of money.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">President Moon has been keeping a close eye on the proceed- ings surrounding these water rights. She would much rather see Wakkanai continue to maintain Republic City’s water supply than to hand the job over to an unknown entity like San Ho.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That said, the President can only do so much, and Zhu Li knows that tampering with the Commission may lead to dire politi-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cal consequences and accusations that she’s overstepping the bounds of her presidential authority.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, however, San Ho is more than capable of wielding his wealth far more brazenly to directly affect the outcome of the commission’s hearing, while also subduing any word of what he’s done. Without interference from some heroes who can operate a bit more under the radar—like the PCs—San Ho is practically assured to get his way with the committee, sooner or later. Even if this current plan goes awry, he’ll still be able to push things in the direction he wants as long as he isn’t directly implicated with real, substantial evidence—and he’s confident in the power of his money to make sure that any such evidence disappears.</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Money Can Buy… Revenge</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">San Ho’s persona is built around being a busi-</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">ness-genius recluse who hates social engagements. No one knows what he looks like, because he doesn’t want them to and he has the money to make sure it doesn’t happen. While the Korra Era</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">is an era of increased technology, San Ho doesn’t suffer from dealing with issues like photographs snapped of him or nosey reporters. Up until now, the business magnate used his extensive wealth to prevent his identity from being discovered. If a photograph is snapped of him, he buys the film… or hires thugs to track down the reporter and beat them into submission. But now the heroes are involved and it is only a matter of time until they use their unique abilities to unmask this devious mystery man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Varrick’s Abduction</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be fair, this isn’t the first time Varrick has gone missing. Last year, he disappeared for nearly a month—he thought of a new use for moo-sow milk that was only going to work in the Spirit World. The costs of the resulting search led Chief Beifong to institute the “Varrick Rule” in missing persons cases: “That par- ticular idiot has to be missing for at least a week before anyone even talks to me about it.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But despite his penchant for wanderlust, Varrick really has been kidnapped by San Ho. A week before the Spring Pro-Bend- ing Tournament, <b>Varrick received a note from Yinuo, asking for a meeting to settle their old differences</b>. Deeply ashamed of how he treated Yinuo all those years before, Varrick agreed to the meeting, hoping to find some way to set things right but keeping it quiet so as not to unnecessarily expose his misdeeds to the public.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When Varrick snuck out of the tournament to meet with Yinuo, he was shocked to find that the meeting was a trap. San Ho and his hired Terra Triad goons dragged Varrick away…and now they plan to kill him in the same explosion they will use to discredit Wakkanai!</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">President Moon knew her husband was stepping out for a meeting, though he refused to tell her for what, and he should’ve returned by now. Zhu Li has plenty of other issues to worry about right now <span class="p">(including San Ho’s manipulation</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the Utilities Commission). <b>But Varrick’s disappearance strikes her as particularly worrisome</b>, perhaps because of the many other events surrounding it. She can’t easily explain her concerns or provide evidence for them—so she doesn’t want to spend significant favors or political capital on it, and she definitely doesn’t want to trouble Chief Beifong yet—but she still believes she needs to act sooner than later. That’s why she contacts the heroes, relying upon them to investigate the disap- pearance of her husband before something terrible happens!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Wei Tia’s Reluctance</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wei Tia is the Terra Triad’s chief lieutenant in Republic City<span class="p">. Within the Triad, he’s technically below his boss, Steely Ning.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part157.htm#bookmark368" class="s25">Steely Ning is just San Ho’s pawn, though, a puppet San Ho helped to rise to the top of the Triad to ensure the businessman could control the organization. In reality, Wei Tia is the one Triad members actually look to. Wei Tia is aware that without San Ho’s massive influx of cash into the organization it all would have fallen apart—the Terra Triad survived thanks to San Ho (see page 175).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But Wei Tia has come to see and understand the scope of San Ho’s plot, and he’s worried. San Ho wants vengeance upon people who harmed him—this, Wei Tia understands. But San Ho’s plan involves targeting the First Gentleman, a dangerous proposition that threatens to bring the wrath of the Republic City police down upon the Terra Triad if it’s successful, and it involves destroying the primary water treatment facility for the whole city. Wei Tia doesn’t have strong feelings either way about Wakkanai, but he’s aware that if the city starts suffering water shortages as a result of the bombs, the people most likely to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">suffer are the poor and powerless—in other words, the ones Wei Tia thinks of as friends, family, and neighbors.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wei Tia is torn between his loyalty to the Triad (and his fearful respect of San Ho) and his concerns about what this plot might really do<span class="p">, both to the Triad and to the city he calls home. Over the course of the day as the plot draws closer, Wei Tia comes ever nearer to betraying Steely Ning and San Ho, and he may be the key to stopping the bombing before it happens.</span>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Putting It All Together</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is essentially a detective story. The clues chain together, but the players can take various avenues to find the captives and stop the abduction plot.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The PCs must come to understand several key truths by the end of the adventure to put together the full mystery:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• San Ho and the Terra Triad are behind Varrick’s kidnapping. They planned to put him in the water treatment facility and then blow it up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• No one, besides top members of the Terra Triad, has seen San Ho in person since he’s been active in Republic City.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• San Ho is actually Yinuo, the disgraced and betrayed former partner of Wakkanai, and he actually helped build the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">water treatment facility. Varrick orchestrated the betrayal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Wakkanai didn’t know about Varrick’s misdeeds then, and she certainly doesn’t know that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Yinuo and San Ho are the same person.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Utilities Commission vote has already been tampered with by San Ho’s bribery and will be tipped all the way if the bombing of the water treatment plant is successful.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Varrick wants to make amends for his past misdeeds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These key truths are called out so that you, the GM, can make sure they come across at the appropriate times. There is little value in letting the PCs “put the pieces together” if they’re going to come to a false or incomplete understanding; it’s better just to have characters outright explain some of the above—or to help put the clues together yourself in a way that befits what the PCs</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">would understand—than to let the PCs flail about in the dark. So as the PCs look for clues, be sure to look for opportunities to drive these truths home; the real fun of this adventure is de- ciding how to resolve the conflicts, not merely discovering what those conflicts are.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, the key mysteries and problems the PCs have to solve include finding and rescuing Varrick, stopping the bomb plot, and somehow handling San Ho himself<span class="p">. There is no particular order or set of requirements around these prob- lems—if the PCs find out about the bombing and stop it, and then rescue Varrick, that’s just as good as the PCs finding Varrick first and then stopping the bombing. There is no reason to keep the PCs from “solving” the situation too early—the fact that there are three different complicated problems means there’s plenty to do, no matter when the heroes get to each problem.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Here are some important pieces of information about how and where the PCs might solve each of those key problems:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Varrick is held at Warehouse 26, owned by the San Ho Consortium, until he is moved to the water treatment facility while the bomb preparations are being finished. For the PCs to free him, they’re going to have to deal with San Ho’s mercenaries, as well</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">as likely Steely Ning and even San Ho himself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• There are already bombs at the water treatment facility being hidden and set by Terra Triad members, so when they detonate, the damage will appear to be from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">negligence and poor upkeep. Final preparations are only made later at night, shortly before the actual bombing, but the PCs will either have to navigate the facility covertly during the day, or they’ll have to contend with direct opposition from the Terra Triad at night.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• San Ho moves around a bit and might be found in many locations, but he is most likely at his offices at or near Warehouse 26. He will try to flee if he detects anyone coming his way, racing to his own Satomobile and calling available guards and henchmen to cover his escape. Even if caught,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the PCs likely will need some degree of evidence to fully implicate him—for example, a confession from Wei Tia.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keep in mind that the PCs don’t actually have to solve every single problem perfectly for the adventure to come to a satisfy- ing conclusion. They do, however, have to become aware of each of the key truths and each of the key problems by the end, and likely they need to have attempted to solve at least one of the key problems. If they don’t have a full picture of what’s going on in the mystery, then the adventure won’t actually have concluded. Similarly, if they don’t get a chance to actually act on all the in- formation they’ve learned, that can be pretty frustrating for the players. Make sure that the situation is relatively clear to the PCs, and that they get a chance to actually act to change what’s going to happen before the end of the adventure!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How It Ends</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the heroes start looking into Varrick’s whereabouts and San Ho’s shady business dealings, they will quickly find out the truth: San Ho is angry about how he was treated all those years ago and eager to get his revenge on the people who “took everything” from him. The heroes have to figure out a way to rescue Varrick and put a stop to San Ho’s plans to destroy Wakkanai’s life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The characters can resolve the situation in any way they’d like, but here are some suggestions for how things might end up.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Finding Varrick before he is moved to the water treatment facility means he’s safe from the plot to kill him, but the facility is still in danger from the bombs, and Wakkanai might still lose her rights to serve the city’s water treatment needs. Finding him at the facility means the PCs have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">to free him and escape before the bombs go off!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Stopping the plot against the water treatment plant almost certainly provides the PCs with enough evidence to at least indicate foul play in Wakkanai’s discrediting. It might not be enough to implicate San Ho, but it would probably keep Wakkanai in charge of the plant, and likely put away the criminal allies San Ho was using to get the job done.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs might successfully heal the wounds between San Ho and Wakkanai by helping them reconcile, although it will be tough to help San Ho overcome his intense hatred (requiring the PCs to shift his balance down considerably). Failing to change San Ho’s mind means he fully commits to his vengeance and hatred.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the best-case scenario, the PCs rescue Varrick, provide evidence of the conspiracy to President Moon, and help apprehend San Ho. <span class="p">In the worst-case scenario, the water treatment facility explodes, Wakkanai’s rights are revoked by the Utilities Commission, and Varrick remains missing—practically guaranteeing the PCs need to continue to act to set things right!</span>

<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Try to think of this adventure like an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. The adventure could end with <i>the heroes bringing Wakkanai to see San Ho at the water treat- ment center in an attempt to repair the wounds of the past</i>; or the adventure could end with <i>the players confronting San Ho alone, battling him and his Terra Triad goons to stop him from blowing up the treatment center</i>. Regardless, the end of the adventure should give the players a chance to feel special—and to feel that their actions make a real difference to the future of Republic City.</p>
