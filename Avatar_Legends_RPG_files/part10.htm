			<span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>depends <i>upon a crucial core idea</i>: play to find out what happens.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">There will be times in the story when you think you know ex- actly what should happen next, when the path of the tale you’ve been telling becomes clear and you feel like you know just where the game should go next. You just <i>know </i>the mysterious enemy you’ve been tracking through Omashu should turn out to be your estranged sister, and you’re <i>so sure </i>you should confront each other in an exciting duel that ends with you both in tears! It would be <i>perfect</i>! The GM should <i>make it happen</i>!</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But as Uncle Iroh said, “Destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out.” Part of the fun of this game is not knowing where the story will go. Let go of the need to control the narrative and play to find out what happens! Don’t pre-plan your story; instead let the mechanics lead you into unexpected, novel outcomes based on the conflicts that emerge from the decisions you’ve made throughout the game.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

			<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Discipline and Destiny</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playing to find out requires discipline from the players and the GM, a commitment to the mechanics of the game and how they play out over time. You are the authors of this story, but one of the main reasons to play a roleplaying game—instead of just telling stories around the campfire—is that the mechanics of the game al- low you to make real decisions, to commit to choices and find out what happens when those choices play out in front of you.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In order for those decisions to have meaning, you have to commit to both the decision and the consequence. For example, if your character refuses to help her brother with his scheme to take over the family’s business, you’ve made a choice—as an author</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the story and a player of the game—about how you want your tale to go. You’ve made a statement about what matters to you, perhaps even altering your internal balance!</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Yet…the outcome might lead you to wish you had done some- thing different. Perhaps your character’s brother will turn against her, filled with malice at her “betrayal,” or he might win and decide to cut her and her companions off from crucial resources in an important moment. It’s tempting in those moments to try to un- dermine the costs and consequences, to argue that things should be easier or that your decision mattered less than it did.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But what kind of story avoids loss and misfortune completely? What memorable tales focus on heroes who make every decision perfectly? Your story only has meaning if the choices you and your friends make feel as real to you as they do to your characters.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Of course, the Avatarverse is filled with prophecies and foretellings, destinies bestowed upon heroes that they must live up to before their stories are done. You don’t have to ignore these when you’re playing to find out what happens, but you do need to keep an open mind! Myths and legends rarely play out the way we think they must—surprises abound!— and your character’s story is no different. Allow yourself to be surprised by what happens when you play the game, and your story will be richer for it.</p>
			<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Safety Tools</p>
			<p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game <span class="p">is a family-friendly game, open to anyone who wants to journey across the Four Nations to restore balance to the world. At the same time, following the game where it takes your story can sometimes lead you to</span>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">some pretty uncomfortable spaces, especially around the darker themes of <i>Avatar Legends </i>stories like genocide and loss. It’s okay to tackle these kinds of serious subjects, provided you and your group have the tools you need to handle such a situation.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In general, it’s always a good idea to talk about the game. Talk about it before you start, talk about it during play, talk about it after. Check in with your fellow players often and be sure everyone is having fun together. Be mature and under- standing with each other as you talk about how the game af- fected you and others, including times in which you disagreed about what should happen or how it felt.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Beyond talking, there are many tools for keeping your table on the same page, to make sure the game is comfortable and fun for everyone. Here are a few of our favorites!</p>
		<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Lines and Veils</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lines and Veils is an exercise developed by Ron Edwards and expanded on by the gaming community to help your group have a discussion about what content you want to exclude completely (lines) and what content you want to fade to black on instead</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of showing it “on-screen” (veils). <i>Avatar Legends </i>focuses on family-friendly stories, but the Avatar Kyoshi novels have a very different tone than Avatar Aang’s story!</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Before you sit down to play, ask every player—including the GM—to contribute to a shared list of lines and veils. Players should add content they don’t want to see at all in the game to the list of lines and content they want to include (but not see directly) on the list of veils. Lines should never appear in your game; veiled content can be included, but it is never shown directly. Each group’s preferences for lines and veils is different!</p>

		<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The X-Card</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The X-Card is a handy tool originally developed by John Stav- ropoulos. Take an index card or a piece of paper and draw an X on it, and then put it in the middle of your table. That’s your</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">X-Card. If someone is feeling uncomfortable out-of-character in any way because of something happening in the game, they can point to, tap, or hold up the X-Card—whatever works for them.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In that moment, everybody in the group stops, and the player who used the card explains how they’d like to change, remove, or skip past the content that made them uncomfortable. It’s up to them whether they explain why. The other players may have</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a few questions to make sure they understand exactly what was X-Carded. Once you’re ready to start again, you can pick up where you left off, leaving out whatever was X-Carded.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In practice, the X-Card is as important just to have as it is to actually use. A lot of players feel much more comfortable know- ing that the X-Card is there, whether or not they actually have to use it. It’s an especially great tool when you’re playing with people you don’t know all that well!</p>
