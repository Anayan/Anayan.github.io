<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this chapter, there are four new playbooks designed to open up a whole new array of additional character and story arcs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for your games of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Every playbook gives a new set of options for players to aim for the kind of character and story they’re interested in, and these four playbooks present all new paths to stories for your game!</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playbook Advice</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The world of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is filled with countless stories and countless heroes, of all shapes and sizes. Their stories are as varied as their ideologies and their abilities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This book includes four new playbooks, each one expanding the options and stories available in your game. For more on playbooks, see <b>Chapter 6: Playbooks </b>of the core book.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Using these Playbooks</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These playbooks are all a bit more specific, a bit more focused than the ten available in the core book, but they can be used just like those playbooks. You can add these four to the original ten, or you can pick and choose a particular set of options for a game. These playbooks have some more complicated ideas and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mechanical elements than the original set, so a brand-new player might be better off picking one of the original ten playbooks. But none of them are so strange or complicated that they’re out of reach—play what calls to you!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Here are a few ideas of particular playbook mixes, each one focusing on a couple themes. The playbooks in each mix will portray different aspects of each theme: :</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Responsibility and Expectations: </b>The Destined, the Foundling, the Guardian, the Icon, the Successor</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Students and Teacher: </b>The Bold, the Elder, the Pillar, the Prodigy, the Razor</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Identity and Hope: </b>The Adamant, the Foundling, the Idealist, the Razor, the Rogue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Justice and Struggle: </b>The Adamant, the Bold, the Destined, the Elder, the Hammer</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bringing to the Table</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These playbooks, like the rest, will work well for a brand new character. Existing characters can always switch over to one of these new playbooks should the time come—see page 218 of the core book for more on switching playbooks as you advance your character or play your campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember that when PCs take moves from other playbooks, they can always take moves from any playbooks, even those</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that aren’t currently used in your game. That means each one of these playbooks expands the overall pool of available moves for every character. You cannot, on the other hand, take any of the special, unique <b>features </b>of other playbooks without switching into those playbooks—no taking the Destined’s Marked By Fate while you’re playing as the Bold!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Mentors of the Avatarverse</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you’ve ever wanted to play a character like Tenzin, Lin, or Iroh, then the Elder is the playbook for you! The other playbooks generally aim for younger, less proven characters, but the Elder is perfect for playing an established adult, someone who has al- ready carved out a place in the world, but still has much to learn. The Elder is especially good as a supporting mentor for the other PCs—they are the focus of their own story, but the playbook has a lot of incentives to guide others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you are interested in playing a character whose drive is especially directed toward helping the other PCs in your game to grow—whose own path to learning and growth goes through the other heroes—then the Elder is exactly who you’ve been looking for!</p>
