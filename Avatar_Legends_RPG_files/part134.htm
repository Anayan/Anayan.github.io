<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the basic plot of <b>Fire &amp; Brimstone </b>is relatively simple (solve the mystery of the crates and do something about them), there are as many ways to accomplish that as there are players. Here are some suggestions for keeping things exciting, including using a GM tool—escalations—to amp up the excitement in your game.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Between Rust’s instability, the meteorite metal, and the politi- cal machinations going on at the summit, the heroes have their hands full. If at any point they seem too comfortable, you can use escalations to reignite conflicts, cause new problems, or even unravel their progress by making them reassess what they think they know. Escalations are new dynamics in the problems, immi- nent dangers, or crucial decisions. If your players seem ready for a new challenge or you’re not sure what to do, use an escalation. Here are some examples you can use:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Hong reveals his true identity to the characters and attempts to strike a bargain, using them as allies against whichever nation is the worthiest target in his mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The friction between Pohu and Taqukaq finally comes to a head, with the two shouting at each other. Without</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">intervention by the heroes, the two Water Tribe members will come to blows in the middle of a colloquium.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• An overzealous Fire Nation officer arrests Ikru after overhearing him talk about what he’d do with the stolen metal. This leads to the Earth Kingdom delegation loudly breaking him out of prison and clashing with Fire Nation guards outside Zoryu Hall. Eventually the guards win, and the entire Earth Kingdom delegation is arrested.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Rust, under the effects of imbalance, decides the Twisting Dragon sculpture smells tasty and nibbles a piece off. Unfortunately, the piece regulated the sculpture’s fire emitters; the sculpture unpredictably spews flames, and if no one intervenes, it will explode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Khuchtei gets frustrated by not knowing who’s to blame and orders a lockdown of Tako Dormitory, making it nearly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">impossible for anyone to investigate other buildings or sneak into delegates’ rooms.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Clues</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mysteries live and die by their clues. When there aren’t enough clues, players might feel like they don’t know what to do or, worse, feel like they’re stuck on a path where none of their choices matter. At the same time, players with dozens of clues can have the same problem; having too many possible directions to take can result in decision paralysis, where people spend all their time thinking about the many options instead of actually choosing anything. Striking a good balance is vital; you want to give your players enough freedom to have fun and feel in control of their characters without smothering them. A good rule of thumb is to ensure the PCs have three good avenues of investiga- tion at all times.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the start of the adventure, there are four suspects. In addition to questioning these people, the characters can also search the suspects’ rooms, search their delegation’s compart- ment of the summit storehouse, or spy on them. Keep in mind that “searching” is likely some combination of finding things it’s believable the PCs would find (without triggering a move); <b>relying on skills and training </b>to find particularly hidden or more uncertain items; and <b>assessing the situation</b>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This means there are numerous paths to take at the begin- ning. To prevent overwhelming your players, have Taqukaq suggest investigating just one suspect to start. Pick the suspect you think would be most fun to play and that you’re confident you can portray well. This way, the players start off with a few possible choices.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Making Good Clues</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While clues are included throughout the adventure, they cannot possibly cover all of the questions players may ask, so it’s up to you to come up with a few of your own. Clues should be useful to the investigation. It’s no fun to spend a half hour avoiding guard patrols, sneaking through windows, and picking locks just to learn that Sumati likes Northwestern Earth Kingdom folk music—that is, unless such a discovery is a vital clue!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Instead, make your clues information that could help the players understand the situation. All the PCs have their own ex- pertise in their training and backgrounds, so they will all notice different things. Respect their backgrounds and training with the clues you bring up; the outlaw notices hidden panels, but the monastic PC might have the knowledge necessary to notice hidden messages. Don’t try to obscure information unnecessar- ily! The information the PCs find should always be interesting and relevant, and anything they don’t find or pay attention to ul- timately turns out to be unimportant. Build the mystery around their actions and learning instead of forcing them to follow a path you lay out.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s24">Player Knowledge vs. PC Knowledge and Clues </span>One of the biggest pitfalls of a clue-assembling mystery story in a game like <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is demanding that the players assemble all the clues themselves, as if the PCs were themselves on the ground and holding a magnifying glass up to footprints. Players never have direct access to the clues and the evidence; everything they know about the mystery comes mediated through the GM, which means they have to trust that the GM is telling them everything they would know or notice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs are missing a crucial clue because it’s in one corner of the room, and they never found it because they never specifically said that they searched that corner, then the players are likely to become very frustrated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Instead of making the players act as perfect sleuths, describ- ing each and every thing they examine and exactly how they examine it, play a bit more on their side. When a PC investigates a room, you should assume they investigated the room in all rea- sonable ways and provide them with any information they might reasonably have discovered, whether or not the player specifical- ly describes the PC taking any particular action.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, the PCs bring all manner of knowledge and expertise into the scene itself. A technologist would recognize the nature of the Earth Kingdom exhibit’s contraptions; a weapons user might already know the value of meteorite iron for weapons making; and so on. Err on the side of providing the PCs with plentiful information, instead of limiting the information you provide. If it’s reasonable that the PC might know some piece of information already, you can just tell them; if you still feel there is doubt, have them <b>rely on their skills and training </b>to resolve whether they have the knowledge to overcome the difficulties in the moment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The point here isn’t to just give the players the answer—they still have to choose where to search, and depending on the group, they might get a kick out of doing more assembly of the different clues. The point here is to make sure that if their charac- ters would know or put together information, then the players get that information; if the Waterbender would be able to put together how the meteorite metal might have been smuggled out of the city through a nearby flowing pipe, then the player should be provided with that same information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, consider how you use dramatic irony throughout the game. Dramatic irony here refers to those moments when the player knows information that the PC doesn’t; for example, if the PCs split up, the players might hear conversations other</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">characters have in other locations, sharing information that their own characters couldn’t possibly know yet. If the players are bought into the drama and story of the game, then they can help heighten the tension of the story by playing into these moments. For example, if a player rolls a miss while trying to <b>guide and comfort </b>Pohu, you might ask them, “Pohu is definitely hiding something here; why don’t you notice it?” The player now knows Pohu is hiding something, but they buy into how their character misses the detail by providing that explanation. If you can get the players to buy into these moments, you can further put them into a mindset in which the overall story you’re telling together is more important than any individual player’s ability to success- fully assemble the clues.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Investigation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Players can investigate by searching locations, spying on people, or simply asking questions. There are plenty of locations to search, from the delegates’ rooms in Tako Dormitory to the different areas of the summit storehouse. Additionally, a few of the NPCs sneak out at night, allowing the heroes to follow them and see what they’re up to.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Searching</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The first step in searching is getting inside. In most cases, this means the heroes need to sneak past guards or convince staff they need access. In addition to most of the basic moves—such as <b>plead</b>, <b>intimidate</b>, <b>trick</b>, and <b>guide and comfort</b>—many characters have useful moves. Rifling through papers or looking for hidden items often means the PCs are <b>relying on their skills and training</b>, but some characters might have a more applicable move. And sometimes characters might just discover clues with- out triggering a move—their background and skill set remove the uncertainty from the search. Useful clues are listed in each</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the “Important Locations” entries. Most clues are ambiguous, allowing you and the players to decide which suspect is the thief and which suspects are merely shady characters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In general, when PCs search for clues, they should never come up totally empty-handed. That doesn’t mean they find a clue wherever they go! But even when the PCs discover that there is nothing to find in a place, that’s a kind of clue. Don’t hesitate to state things so definitively after the PCs search—the overall adventure functions much more smoothly when PCs’ searches can both turn up clues and prove that there are no more clues to find in a place.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Questioning People</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The PCs will eventually need to ask some direct questions. Lucky for them, they have plenty of moves available to help convince the delegates to give up information. Even if a charac- ter doesn’t have a relevant move from their playbook, they can always <b>guide and comfort</b>, and if an NPC opens up to them, the character gets to ask a question. While these conversations could take many forms and involve many questions, you’ll want to limit the number of actual clues the players receive from any one conversation. After all, if one person who wasn’t the culprit had all the information needed to crack the case, why didn’t they solve it and let the PCs relax?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This isn’t about “hiding information from players,” however. Some NPCs might know more than they’re openly willing to say—although even they might spill the beans after a successful <b>guide and comfort </b>or <b>trick</b>—but as a GM, you still want the PCs to piece together the mystery. Always couch the informa- tion gleaned from NPCs in terms of providing new courses of action. If a PC just questions an NPC, you can describe how sketchy or shady they’re acting—they’re clearly hiding some- thing, and PCs will thus have reason to try additional moves on them. Alternatively, an NPC with nothing to hide will just an- swer questions, openly and honestly, to the best of their ability.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Even outside of the results of a move like <b>plead</b>, keep in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mind that NPCs might also offer information in exchange for something else . Nearly all of the NPCs in this adventure have some degree of political savvy, and they will be willing to make deals to get what they want. They might ask for anything from information or blackmail on the other delegations, to straight up sabotage of the other delegations’ materials. PCs who have time to investigate may not give an answer right away, but the more pressing things become, the more likely they will be to consider such a difficult deal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs might ask questions of any of the important NPCs, but they also might seek answers from other NPCs and dele- gates. Feel free to invent additional delegates as needed; they might even be figures the PCs know based on their own back- grounds and experiences. Consider the write-ups on the overall groups of delegates when you create new individual members; they will likely still be aligned with the overall delegation’s purpose and behavior. Those new NPCs can easily provide ways to communicate additional important information, but they shouldn’t draw suspicion away from the primary suspects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For any NPC the heroes decide to question, make sure to play to their conditions and their balance, especially as they rack up more conditions and shift their balance ever farther down the track. The NPCs become more and more strained and unbal- anced over the course of the summit, and PCs might even come to see how tense the situations is growing if they question the same NPC twice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, the NPCs themselves might acquire new infor- mation over the course of the summit. They’re not static; they are taking action on their own, and they might come to the PCs with new evidence, new suspicions, and new requests.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Running Simultaneous Scenes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clever PCs may wish to question a suspect (or at least distract them by chatting for a while) while the rest of the team digs through their stuff. Or heroes may wish to investigate multiple suspects at the same time. If the players choose to do this, it’s important to jump between the different scenes. Otherwise, everyone’s waiting for the first scene to finish before they get to do anything. Also, understand your limits as GM. As much</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fun as it is for six players to each act independently in their own scene, that may be more than some GMs can handle. As a rule of thumb, if you haven’t run simultaneous scenes before, limit your- self to three. This doesn’t mean that any of the players have to sit out; you can suggest that they work in pairs or small groups.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In order to keep excitement high, think about how similar scenes in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legend of Korra </i>play out. The focus often changes right before the audience learns in- teresting things or just as someone’s about to get caught. You can duplicate this experience for your players by switching scenes right after a dice roll (but before you tell them the outcome of the roll). You can also switch after they open a door or contain- er (but before you tell them what’s inside), after an NPC says something interesting (but before they explain it), or just as a guard patrol rounds the corner (but before the players announce any actions). This ensures that your players are excited to learn what comes next.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Things can get especially interesting when simultaneous scenes start to converge with dramatic irony; for example, when a suspect doesn’t want to be delayed any further and starts heading to their room. The character searching the room might not know they’re seconds away from being discovered, but their player does. This creates fun tension that you can use to create excitement, especially if the suspect reaches their door, and instead of telling either of those players what happens next, you switch to the third scene.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Always remember, however, that the NPCs are active and the overall setting is not still. Use the NPCs’ actions to set scenes that bring the PCs together. The PCs might not always get the opportunity to split up exactly as they like. Sometimes, the NPCs will take action that demands a response—as two differ- ent groups of delegates stand ready to get into a fight, the PCs’ attention will be drawn to that location!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, an NPC who approaches the PCs with some kind of offer or request might either choose to do so when all the PCs are together, or might strategically isolate the hero they think</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is most sympathetic to their cause. If the PCs are splitting up all the time, then perhaps just as they’re about to do so, Rust approaches them, asking for help with what’s happening to the spirit. They still might choose to split up afterward, but it’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">important to have some scenes where they all interact and share what they have learned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, remind the players that if their characters all stick together, they might be able to aid each other more effectively. If they split up, they can cover more ground more quickly, and you should honor that by slowing down the rate at which the situa- tion worsens over time; but if they stick together, they can <b>help </b>each other to ensure they can actually achieve their goals.</p>

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shifting From Politics to Fighting <span class="p">The initial stage of this adventure is very political: the mete- orite metal has been stolen, but no party is quite ready yet to accuse and directly confront any other. Even though the theft hangs over the heads of every delegate, Khuchtei is still having the conference continue, and all the delegates are more or less playing along. As such, when the PCs begin to investigate the</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">theft, they’re not running around in a city thrown into turmoil; instead, they’re still expected to uphold all the same responsi- bilities and proprieties as always, especially if they’re delegates themselves. Outright fighting is forbidden, and without clear evidence of someone’s wrongdoing, any combat will unite all the other delegates in opposition to the aggressor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the summit continues without a culprit being discovered, however, the situation grows more and more tense. The dele- gates themselves grow more and more likely to get into a fight, at first verbally, but eventually physically. The myriad delegations’ guards begin to threaten and oppose each other. The entire sum- mit becomes a powderkeg, and it’s only a matter of time before someone lights the fuse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">To represent this degradation from polite etiquette and prop- er manners into a tenser and tenser situation, consider shifting NPCs’ balance and inflicting conditions on NPCs in between scenes. Conditions make NPCs more likely to be taken out,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but they give a guideline to how those NPCs will act and what emotions they’re feeling. Balance shifts make NPCs more and more committed to their ideals, and similarly more dangerous in fights. Try to balance equally inflicting conditions and balance shifts across the NPCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you are playing a faster-paced game, with PCs reasonably finding the answers within a single in-fiction day, then focus on the number of major discoveries or interactions the PCs have had; for each significant new piece of information they’ve</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">uncovered, inflict a balance shift or a condition on an appropri- ate NPC. For example, if the PCs interrogate Pohu and learn his suspicions about Taqukaq’s own secret behavior, then you might inflict a balance shift or a condition (like Troubled) on Pohu or on Taqukaq to represent the growing tension.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">If you are playing a slower-paced game, with the PCs taking the full length of the summit to conduct their investigations, then you can focus on individual days passing, in addition to major discoveries. For each day that passes, inflict two balance shifts and two conditions on NPCs as you feel appropriate. Feel free to reference interactions between them that happened off- screen as an explanation for why they’re now feeling this way—if Pohu and Taqukaq had a massive argument off-screen, then it’s fair for both of them to come away with a condition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">You can also usefully limit, alter, or manipulate the amount of fatigue and conditions any character clears across the length of the adventure. If the PCs can clear fewer and fewer fatigue or conditions as days pass, then it implies they are becoming more and more strained.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, always remember that Rust will move towards Chaos the more direct conflict there is between any people at the summit. Feel free to take these opportunities to also shift Rust further toward Chaos and create even greater threats that demand attention.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Additional Questions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Below are a few common questions you may have after reading this adventure and some suggestions for how to answer them.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: center;">What if my players focus on the diplomatic problems?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your players may decide that the proceedings in the summit are more pressing than the meteorite metal. This is completely un- derstandable! After all, the delegates are trying to keep the world at peace. A major diplomatic incident could throw the nations into a cold war—or worse! There’s nothing wrong with shifting the game’s focus from a tale of intrigue to a diplomatic struggle. Of course, once the PCs smooth out any diplomatic wrinkles, you can reintroduce the problem of the crates, this time with a time limit; now that the summit is nearly over, they only have one day to find the culprit and the crates of meteorite metal.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What are the actual exhibits and shows of technological prowess at the summit? <span class="p">There are some ideas and details for those exhibits, especially in the description of what each nation is holding within the warehouse, that might give you ideas. But in the end, this adventure isn’t actually directly about those inventions, it’s about the politics and the theft of the meteorite metal. If you need details of those inventions, invent them!</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Make them interesting, exciting, but highly theoretical—the in- ventions here all have the potential of changing the world if only the inventors can work out the kinks, and most of those kinks will never be worked out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<b>How can I hurry this up? </b>Because of the nature of mysteries, players often spend a lot of time thinking about evidence and avenues of investigation instead of actively learning new things. While this might not be a problem for some games, games with strict time limits—such as convention games or streamed actual plays—sometimes need help speeding things along. If this is true of your game, use an escalation. Have two parties get in a fight or tensions come to a head, speeding up Rust’s deteriora- tion in the process. This escalation should reveal new informa- tion about the plot <i>and </i>get your players into the action.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">My players missed a major clue; how can I get them to see it? <span class="p">No clue is ever truly “missed.” Think of clues as coming up wherever the PCs go, and around whatever the PCs choose to look at. If they “miss a clue,” then they might always find that information somewhere else. Just as easily, an NPC might</span>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">approach them with the information, although that might come with strings. And in the worst case scenario, consider whether or not a “missed” clue is really important. If the PCs didn’t find it, maybe it doesn’t play a role in your story!</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What if the NPCs start fighting each other? <span class="p">Between the important characters and the delegations as a whole, the NPCs in this adventure have a lot of enmity for each other! As tensions rise, they’re much more likely to turn their animosity onto one another, instead of aiming it at the PCs, with the possible excep- tion of the actual thief hoping to knock the PCs off their trail. At some point, it might be an appropriate GM move or escalation to spark a fight between the NPCs. Remember that if they start fighting and the PCs aren’t involved, then there is no uncertain- ty—you just say what happens—and it’s a golden opportunity to make some hard moves! If the PCs jump in, emphasize what they’re trying to do; maybe they’re just using a move, and a com- bat exchange isn’t necessary at all.</span>
