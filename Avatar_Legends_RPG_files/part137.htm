<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The companions are tasked with providing security for Onomu, a Fire Nation defector who is offering war plans stolen from Fire Lord Ozai’s palace to Grand Secretariat Long Feng in exchange for asylum in Ba Sing Se. However, a hero’s job is never easy, and a few obstacles stand in their way. The Armadillo-Bears, a group of Earth Kingdom rebels, heard Onomu is in the Earth Kingdom and want to capture her. If that wasn’t enough to worry about, the Rough Rhinos also have orders to capture (or kill) the defec- tor and destroy the war plans at all costs! Meanwhile, from the shadows, Long Feng moves his pieces across the Pai Sho table, benefiting greatly from the chaos…Can the heroes get the plans to safety and save Onomu’s life before it’s too late?</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using This Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The contents of this adventure create a sandbox for your PCs where they can adventure through the setting and help shape the course of the Hundred Year War. Some of the tools available to you are found in these sections:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Summary” provides an outline of the adventure and relevant details.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Introduction” offers an idea of where the adventure could start.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Characters &amp; Groups” provides expanded descriptions and relevant rules information for the characters and groups PCs might encounter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Locations” includes different places the PCs could visit; unlike in other adventures, where these locations are linked to NPCs, the locations in <b>Ash &amp; Steel </b>will be scenic backdrops the GM can use to base the various NPCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “GM Advice” contains guidance and suggestions to help the GM ensure the adventure runs smoothly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Pregenerated Characters” is a set of five premade characters your players can use to hop right into the adventure. We also include a hook that ties the characters to the adventure.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">No Path to the End?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are used to running adventures with heavily detailed encounters and prepared NPCs, it might come as a surprise that few mechanics are written into this adventure, beyond the esca- lations and some information about various characters. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>relies on players triggering moves based on the actions they take during play instead of asking players to make any specific checks for specific actions required by the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since every significant action a PC takes drives the action of the game forward, <b>there is no prescribed order of events</b>. Instead, the adventure puts the PCs in a dramatic starting situ-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ation that demands immediate action from the heroes! It’s your job to use the material in this adventure to keep things moving, providing interesting events and NPCs to consistently engage your players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about running <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game </span>in the core book, <b>Chapter 8: Running the Game</b>, and more about how moves shape play in <b>Chapter 3: Funda- mentals of Play</b>.</p>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s10">Using the Pregenerated Characters </span>There are five pregenerated characters included at the end of this adventure. Each character has a unique history, playbook, and set of stats. Your players can use these characters to play through this adventure, or they can create their own as explained in the <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The pregenerated characters have their moves, feature ele- ments, and techniques already chosen; players need only decide whether to shift their balance by one step at the start of play, and which principle to shift it toward. Players can adjust the pregen- erated characters to make themselves more comfortable, altering names, look, and even mechanical elements like the stat boosted by the free +1 at character creation if they are familiar enough to make that choice. The characters are designed to work well with the current elements included and the adventure as presented, but as always, if the GM and player agree then they can make changes as desired. After selecting the pregenerated characters, players will still go through the process of filling out connections with each other.</p>
