<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following pages contain information on these NPCs, along with stats you can use for them in game—a principle (when appropriate), combat techniques, conditions, and fatigue are all listed for each character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">NPCs tied to a faction or group that come into play in the adventure are listed after the faction itself. In a combat, the gang and the leader would act separately in exchanges and choosing techniques.</p>
<p class="s75" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rangi</p>
<p class="s127" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legendary NPC</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rangi is a skilled Firebender and one of the Avatar’s compan- ions. When Avatar Kyoshi left Ba Sing Se for other business, she left Rangi to keep an eye on things. While Rangi isn’t in charge of the <i>daofei </i>task force, she had been working with it before Kyoshi left. She doesn’t have the sway that the Avatar has though, and has watched the change in the task force’s direction</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with trepidation. In the face of recent events like the kidnapping, Rangi doesn’t believe she has enough authority to seize control of the situation, and she’s too easily recognizable to move quietly in the city and try to rescue the children directly. With the PCs around and available to help out, she sees the best option as dispatching them to find the children while she goes for Kyoshi’s help—with Kyoshi in Ba Sing Se, they can take control of the situation for sure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s127" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major NPC</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao is a bow-wielding ex-<i>daofei </i>who has been living in the Lower Ring since childhood. She has had multiple clashes with Hana over the years, and while the two haven’t interacted since Mengyao became a vigilante, the old animosity was enough for Hana to target Mengyao the instant she became a threat to the Fanged Mercenaries. As Hana and Lei Fang successfully turn the anti-corruption task force against Mengyao, she has to go on the move to keep herself safe and find evidence to prove her innocence. The heroes help define Mengyao’s personality and how she reacts to stimuli in the “Introduction.” Her main goal in all this is to exonerate herself by saving the Fire Nation Am- bassador’s children, though she also hopes to stop the Fanged Mercenaries and bring its leaders to justice.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fanged Mercenaries are made up of a ragtag group of <i>daofei</i>. Many of them only just joined Lei Fang and Hana’s operation, while a select few have been around since the Triad of the Gold- en Wing. Every one of them owes either Lei Fang or Hana for saving them from getting caught by the task force. Even though those raids were engineered by the Mercenaries themselves, their new recruits often don’t have anywhere else to turn. The Mercenaries are only as loyal to each other as they feel they have to be. They know that Hana is ruthless enough to call the task force on her own gang if they act up, and most fear Lei Fang’s prowess in battle. They stay in line, but if they think they can get away with something, they won’t hesitate to turn their backs on their fellows.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hana was Mok’s second-in-command in the Triad of the Golden Wing and an Earthbender with expertise in sandbending. When Avatar Kyoshi disrupted the gang, Hana only escaped capture because she was away on a smuggling mission that day. She later found a few holdouts who escaped the attack, dispersed, and then rallied under Lei Fang. Hana and Lei initially met with tension, as Lei Fang was worried that Hana would try to exert control over the small group. But Hana knew that it was best for her to lead alongside the headstrong leader, so she stepped into the familiar role as second-in-command yet again. Hana is ruth- lessly determined to have her <i>daofei </i>gang rise to the top despite the pressure from the Earth King to eliminate all <i>daofei </i>in the Earth Kingdom. She plans to run the task force ragged before they ever realize she’s behind it.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ambassador Quin is a kind and thoughtful woman who has been genuinely working to keep relations between the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom strong and healthy. Quin’s one weakness is her children. After they went missing, she became determined to find them and ensure their safety, wielding what influence and power she has in this place. While she desperate- ly wants her children returned to her, she also doesn’t want to create an international incident that might undo all her work over the years. She has tasked Tan and his Firebenders to find her children, but at the same time, she is leaning hard on Earth Kingdom officials to do everything they can to find them. She isn’t the kind of woman to sit idly by while other people look for her children. She has been stealing into the Lower Ring at night to search for Gerel and Keiko herself.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After Avatar Kyoshi disrupted the Triad of the Golden Wing and had Mok arrested, the rest of the gang scattered. Lei Fang, one of the gang’s bruisers, started a mercenary group and invited several old gang members to join him. It wasn’t long before Mok’s second-in-command, Hana, found them, and she and Lei Fang formed a new mercenary group, the Fanged Mercenaries. Lei Fang sees the current anti-corruption task force activities as an opportunity to exert dominance in the Lower Ring. He has a plan he hasn’t told Hana about: to begin bribing the task force to look in the other direction when his Mercenaries take action. He has one or two guards on the take, but not enough to make a difference. If he could just get rid of that overachiever, Yong, he could make good inroads.</p>

While Ambas- sador Quin has given them the mandate to steer clear of the Earth Kingdom anti-corruption task force, who are also looking for her children, Tan has given them no such warning. In fact, they have come into conflict with the guards several times while searching the Lower Ring. The Firebenders view the task force as unfocused, at best, and bumbling, at worst. They fear if the task force finds the <i>daofei</i>’s hideout first, they will endanger the children. They don’t dislike Yong, but they don’t trust him. Tan has given them leave to attack anyone who gets in their way, and that includes Yong and his Earthbenders.</p>

Lately, he has been the captain of Ambassador Quin’s personal guard, though his obliga- tions technically stretch to any Fire Nation citizen who comes to the city. He’s been with Quin for ten years, watching her children grow up, and he is protective of them, viewing her family as his own. Tan is getting old, and his attention is slipping, but he has dedicated his entire life to serving the Fire Nation, and he knows nothing else. He regrets that stubbornness now, though. He was taking care of Gerel and Keiko when they were taken from the teahouse a few days prior, and he feels immeasurable guilt over what his inattention has wrought.</p>

<p class="s127" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major NPC group</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Made up of Earth Kingdom soldiers, the anti-corruption task force is theoretically charged with cleaning up troublesome <i>daofei </i>in Ba Sing Se. Under Avatar Kyoshi, they acted like a scalpel, cutting out the dangerous elements from the Lower Ring to allow the citizens to live in relative safety and security. Under Yong’s direction, they act more like a hammer, smashing any criminals or dangerous elements opposing the Earth King. They raid business- es and homes at the slightest provocation, looking for anyone who might be a <i>daofei</i>. The task force is composed of many Earth- benders, but they are not of the same quality as Tan’s Firebenders. While they are loyal to the crown, they aren’t nearly as disciplined, nor as cognizant of the international implications this incident is causing. Yong keeps a loose reign on the task force, giving them leeway to pick fights with Fire Nation soldiers and Lower Ring citizens, which they do with abandon. The stats here represent a single likely group of Earthbenders from the task force, although the task force is composed of many such groups.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yong is an Earthbender who has had a sudden turn of fortune, from unremarkable soldier in the Earth Kingdom military to unit captain of the anti-corruption task force. After so many years of obscurity and drudgery, Yong sees his new job as an opportunity to make a name for himself. Now that the Earth King has given him carte blanche to deal with the <i>daofei</i>, he has risen in prominence. His methods are chaotic, and the results have yet to genuinely pay off, but the spectacle is enough to have largely kept the Earth King and his ministers appeased…until now. To buy himself some time, he has been trying to stop Tan and his soldiers from doing their business, but they have become increasingly hostile toward his guards. He doesn’t want to fight the Firebenders, but he will if that’s what it takes to ensure his group is the one who comes out on top in this situation.</p>
