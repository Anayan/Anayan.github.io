<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes have been busy since the end of the war. The Southern Water Tribe expanded considerably in a short span of time, though the road to revitalization hasn’t been without its obstacles. Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes during the Southern Reconstruction Project finally blew up after a conflict over an oil depository. The Northern Water Tribe sent people to oversee the project, and when they discov- ered the oil depository there, the North attempted to quietly claim control of the resource. Conflict broke out between both tribes, and Gilak, the leader of the southern nationalist uprising, died…though his resentment lives on in many other Southern Tribe members.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hakoda is the current Head Chieftain of the Southern Water</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part32.htm#bookmark84" class="s25">Tribe, while Chief Arnook (page 60)</a> still governs the North, with the South ultimately answering to him as well. Some south- erners fear that the Northern Tribe’s influence and the rate of growth will lead to the Southern Water Tribe’s cultural identity fading. It is hard to completely disregard these fears, seeing as the South Pole is already all but unrecognizable as the same South Pole from before the war.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To that end a younger faction of Southern Water Tribe peo- ple work towards recovering their people’s cultural identity. New Waterbenders are born and strive to discover how their powers connect to their people’s culture. The youth believe their peo- ple’s stories don’t have to fade into history and can be integrated into the tribe’s new future. They’ve set about collecting stories and objects thought lost during the war and archiving them for future generations.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Katara</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A kindhearted waterbending master working to help those in need <a href="part31.htm#bookmark82" class="s25">Katara is one of the few surviving Waterbenders from the South- ern Water Tribe and an essential part of the Avatar’s team. She lost her mother to the Fire Nation’s raiders (page 58)</a>
<span class="p"> and was sepa- rated from her father, Hakoda, while he was off fighting. Together with her older brother Sokka, she helped to bring about the end of the war and continues to aid Avatar Aang whenever she can.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In addition to being an amazing waterbending fighter, Katara is a skilled healer whose talent only grows more powerful with time. She can teach both forms of waterbending, combat and healing, to benders who want to improve their abilities and doesn’t restrict anyone based on gender. Katara is kind, optimis- tic, and protective of her friends. She has a hard time saying no to people in trouble and therefore takes on more than she and her allies can handle.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sokka</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A loyal warrior with a passion for complex plans</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over the past couple of years, Sokka has come into his own as a warrior and an individual. He works with Aang to restore peace and fought alongside him and Katara to end the war. He’s trained as a warrior since his youth and often uses a boomerang in combat. More recently, he trained as a swordsman and forged his own sword out of a meteorite, which he subsequently lost when he foiled a Fire Nation airship attack on the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part37.htm#bookmark94" class="s25">Sokka tends to take things less seriously than his younger sister Katara, but is fiercely loyal to his loved ones. If something were to happen to any of them, he would do whatever it takes to save them. Likewise, if something were to happen to him, he has plenty of people who would stop at nothing to rescue him, including his formidable girlfriend Suki (page 75),</a> the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hakoda</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Chieftain of the quickly growing Southern Water Tribe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the Chieftain of the Southern Water Tribe, Hakoda must call on all the leadership skills he used during the war to lead an</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">expanding community. Hakoda is an intelligent, open, and char- ismatic leader. When he isn’t keeping the Southern and Northern Water Tribes from arguing with one another, he focuses on shap- ing the future of his tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Should they hold strictly to the spiritual traditions of the past or focus on keeping up with the industrial endeavors of other nations? Should the tribe make compromises to appease the North, or should they forge a separate identity? He tackles these questions daily, and the more help he can get, the better. Heroes who want to help have plenty of opportunities to do so as the Chieftain is both trying to grow the tribe and navigate political conflicts that sometimes turn violent.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Malina</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An architect from the Northern Water Tribe living in the South Pole <span class="p">Malina, a Waterbender and brilliant architect, comes from the Northern Water Tribe but now lives with the South. Anyone near the South Pole who needs help with an engineering endeavor would be hard pressed to find someone more capable. Malina recently started a romantic relationship with Hakoda and has been assisting in the Southern Water Tribe’s continued development.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">When Malina first arrived in the South, she originally intend- ed to help the Northern Water Tribe take control, but she ulti- mately changed her mind and decided it was better for the South to grow on their own terms. Her brother, Maliq, did not share her opinion, causing some strife between them. Malina is a good ally for anyone who needs to investigate why certain engineering projects fail and if there’s sabotage involved.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a name="bookmark92">Maliq</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An engineer who wants to see the Northern Water Tribe’s dominance <span class="p">Like his sister Malina, Maliq is an architect and engineer from the Northern Water Tribe. He came to the Southern Water Tribe to as- sist in the Southern Reconstruction Project, believing that the tribe was incapable of helping themselves. Maliq was forced to return to the Northern Water Tribe along with the other northerners who came with the same agenda. Unsurprisingly, his relationship with his sister is strained since their disagreement about the project.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Maliq now works on a plan to convince his sister that he was right about the Southern Water Tribe’s weaknesses as he moves between the North and the South. He will go to great lengths to make his point because he believes it to be for the greater good of both tribes. His biggest advantage is that Malina would love for her brother to turn a new leaf—Maliq could take advantage of that love she has for him.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nakul</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A storyteller recovering her tribe’s lost history</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nakul, a young storykeeper from the Southern Water Tribe, trav- els from village to village collecting stories from the South. After being orphaned in the war, Nakul moved around frequently throughout the years and experienced the enduring spirit of her people through the different memories shared with her by her caretakers. Now, as a young adult, she wants to bring this living history to all members of her tribe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Nakul dreams of building a giant storyhouse in Wolf Cove with archives of all the history she’s collected over the years. She intends to include history not only from the South, but from the North as well, in hopes that discovering shared stories</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">might help heal the bad blood between the two tribes. Currently, Nakul and her fellow storykeepers struggle with reaching the most remote villages of both North and South to collect their stories and could use competent warriors to protect them on their journeys.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Enduring Conflict Between North and South</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Coexistence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the end of the war, the existing tension between the two Water Tribes grows, and the South is rife with murmurs of anti-Northern sentiment. Southern Tribe citizens feel that the Northerners acted selfishly by not providing any assistance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">during the war and now see any Northern offer to help as oppor- tunistic and often selfish. The North’s recent attempt to claim the Southern Tribes’ oil depository stoked fears of the North’s weakness for corruption, and members of the Northern Water Tribe are not especially welcome in the South Pole right now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any earnest offer of help from the North is met with suspicion, as the South isn’t ready to forgive their sister tribe for abandon- ing them during the war. Heroes who need the assistance of both tribes will be hard pressed to get them to cooperate without an argument breaking out, and people from both tribes may even demand them to pick a side.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: left;">Prejudiced Perceptions of the Southern Water Tribe</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Industrial Advancement</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The people of the Southern Water Tribe are among this world’s most resilient survivors, and now that the war is over, they finally have a chance to return to important traditions. It is a time of both remembrance and renewal, and one of the things the tribe needs most right now is time to reconnect with their cultural identity after being forced to focus only on survival for so long. This renais- sance of cultural celebration comes with new industrial growth as the South rebuilds much of what was lost during the war.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most people throughout the world don’t recognize the Southern Water Tribe for its strength, despite the clear example of their prowess when their warriors helped the Avatar defeat Fire Lord Ozai. When they look at the tribe in comparison to its Northern counterpart, which has industrialized significantly throughout the war, they see a collection of villages that has seemingly only just begun to form a larger “civilization”.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recovering Waterbending Prisoners</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Healing Deep Wounds</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation may have freed its Waterbender prisoners at the end of the war, but many of them must still heal from the trauma of their extended imprisonment. Some of the prisoners are elderly, and returning home is only the beginning of their recovery. Some may not feel comfortable in the South Pole after all the changes it’s gone through and how much time they’ve spent away. Still others may discover they have an emotional block that prevents them from waterbending. Those who wish to help these former prisoners have several options, but each recovering Waterbender is a unique case. Helpful heroes could reunite a former prisoner with their long-lost loved ones, find answers to what happened to missing friends, try to figure out how to restore their bending, or accompany them on a quest for revenge against war criminals.</p>
