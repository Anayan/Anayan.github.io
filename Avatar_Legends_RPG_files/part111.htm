</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library exists in every era you might play in with <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. It’s not equally accessible in every era, of course, but the knowledge contained within is always valuable, and heroes with important questions or mysteries always benefit from seeking it out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Here are a few ways to incorporate the Spirit Library into your campaign. The first set of hooks here is a generalized set of ways that the library will likely be of use to your overarching campaign and story; the second set of hooks is a series of era-specific ideas for adventures that bring the Spirit Library to the forefront.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the whole, the library will be of use as:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A way to provide answers, helping PCs solve mysteries or understand some truth of your campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A source of a new plan or purpose that the PCs can pursue moving forward, giving them a clear means to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A repository of important treasures to either obtain or to protect from foes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Providing Answers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Spirit Library is full of lost, secret, or ancient knowledge. That means any deep mysteries of your overarching story likely have answers or solutions within the library’s shelves. Informa- tion about the Destined’s future, or the purpose of those odd crystalline shards the PCs have been collecting to keep them from a dangerous NPC, or the location of the lost Sun Warrior city—all of these and more can be found in Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs may pursue answers from the library on their own, if they have particular knowledge of the library’s existence in their era. But the GM can also help introduce the idea through other characters who seek the library for their own answers; it’s easy enough for the PCs to append a quest for their own knowledge to someone else’s! All it takes is an interested NPC who is pur- suing the library and who understands the utility of partnering with the PCs for the rest of the journey!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If using the library for this purpose, GMs should often feature the foes of the PCs or other antagonistic forces pursuing the library for the same or similar answers of their own. Discovering the answers to questions can lead to moments of high drama as the PCs process everything they learned, but the library is not necessarily going to be a location supportive of that drama, espe- cially if the PCs are in the library with Wan Shi Tong’s blessing, looking for answers openly. Introducing competing forces trying to get to the library, trying to warn Wan Shi Tong about allowing the PCs into the library, and so on can create higher tension and drama around the search for answers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wan Shi Tong himself is unlikely to object much to a desire for answers—after all, that is the most quintessential form of knowledge. But if he objects to how the knowledge is used, he may stand in their way.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Providing a New Plan or Purpose <span class="p">Sojourners often seek the library not for some new understand- ing of the world, but for practical benefit—they want to know how to achieve some goal, or what plan they should enact next. PCs, especially those who feel faced with some insurmountably difficult problem, will often find themselves in need of that exact sort of practical knowledge. Learning how to subdue the enor- mous rampaging spirit, how to destroy the new war machine unleashed by remnants of the Earth Empire, or how to restore the bending of some great hero—all of these are good examples of knowledge sought for practical purpose.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Just as with seeking answers to mysteries, PCs may pursue the library on their own, or they might need a bit of prompting in the form of other NPCs or mentors who suggest the library. For this usage, the library is best thought of as a way to help the PCs past some kind of roadblock; when they know exactly what they want to do, but they feel stuck because they have no</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">idea how to actually do it, the library can provide them with the course they need.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In this instance, the library is much more of a means to an end. Heroes who learn how to achieve their goals from the library must still go out into the world and undertake the appro- priate action—the information itself isn’t enough. As a result, the library here doesn’t have to be a particularly dramatic or significant challenge on its own. That said, the fact that the PCs are pursuing knowledge for some other end—usually to defeat or overcome some threat—is a key sign that Wan Shi Tong wouldn’t approve, and it likely will lead to conflict with the great spirit. That conflict can be enough interesting trouble to make this usage of the library fun and exciting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Holding Treasures</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library has many, many treasures within it. The knowledge held in the shelves of the library is a treasure unto itself, according to Wan Shi Tong, but beyond that there are countless artifacts and wonders that the great spirit has assembled over time. That means if someone is looking for some important relic, there is a very good chance it is held within the halls of the library. The lost jade key to an ancient tomb, the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">last relic of an Avatar from ages past, the compact that proves the ancient obligations of two families to each other—all are good examples of the kinds of important item that either PCs or NPCs might be seeking from the library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This usage of the library has two variations. In the first, the PCs need the object themselves. In the second variation, NPCs are hunting for the object, and the PCs are likely standing in their way. In both cases, GMs should be sure to introduce NPC opposition outside of Wan Shi Tong; other treasure hunters or seekers are the perfect opponents when the library is being used as the repository of some important item. The PCs still have to contend with Wan Shi Tong and the Knowledge Seekers, but all the while they’re in direct competition with other NPCs (whom they can more directly fight). They might be in a race to get to the object first, or they might straight-up help Wan Shi Tong to defend the library from some terrible attacking force.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Era-Specific Hooks</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When using the Spirit Library of Wan Shi Tong in your cam- paign, GMs must keep in mind exactly where the Spirit Library is in their campaign’s era, and the relationship between humans and Wan Shi Tong in that era. The library’s usage will always bet- ter reflect the themes and issues of a particular era if those facts are incorporated—for example, the way that the library might be accessible to mortals, but likely sought for poor, dangerous reasons in the Roku Era or the Hundred Year War Era plays directly into the conflicts of those eras.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, there are always figures in every era who are aware of and interested in the library. Those figures can provide useful allies to the PCs, prompting them to look to the library for possible answers, or they can act as antagonists, standing in the PCs’ way or competing for the same information. GMs using the library should always ground it in the setting still further by making sure there are NPCs who are aware of it and who have opinions on it and its usage.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Paper Knives</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of <i>daofei</i>, the Paper Knives, have successfully stolen a tome of great value and importance from Wan Shi Tong’s library. The tome details secrets of Ba Sing Se’s construction that might give them the edge they need to sneak within the city and even threaten the Earth King. Wan Shi Tong, infuriated by the <i>daofei</i>’s insolence, dispatched Knowledge Seekers to find them and to alert the Avatar. Unfortunately, Kyoshi has no time to rescue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a book—she doesn’t fully understand what’s inside the book, and she’s dealing with other crises, involving <i>people </i>and their <i>lives</i>. She ultimately sets the task of “book recovery” to friends and allies who pass it down the grapevine…to the companions. Can they free the tome from the <i>daofei</i>’s clutches and return it to Wan Shi Tong before the bandits use the information contained within it to attack the Earth King?</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roku Era Hook</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Machines of War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Fire Sage, Bu Kujian, has become aware of other sages and of- ficers in the Fire Nation military planning to seek out the Spirit Library to ransack it for any plans of ancient war machines and weapons. Bu Kujian has been trying to stop them subtly, but ev- ery effort has failed, and he remains terribly worried about what might happen if those plans fall into the hands of his nation’s military leadership. He collects the companions to accompany him on a trip to the library to try to get there first…and then he plans to burn the most dangerous records and knowledge with- in, even if it brings the wrath of Wan Shi Tong down upon him.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hundred Year War Era Hook</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Stolen Maps</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Knowledge Seeker successfully ranged very far south in the world and found knowledge that seemed quite valuable in a village raided by the Fire Nation—hidden maps that lay out the locations of hidden Southern Water Tribe villages, hand-made by one of the best sailors in all the Southern Water Tribe. The Knowledge Seeker took the maps from the village to bring them back to the library. The sailor-cartographer, Quniaq, knows the maps were taken by a Knowledge Seeker, but she doesn’t know much about the Spirit Library, especially where to find it. She pleads with the companions for help to make sure that the maps don’t wind up where anyone from the Fire Nation might find them or otherwise compromise the safety of the hidden villages.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Sniffing Out the Truth</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Things haven’t been going well for the academic Ruiquan Shiang. In her home of Cranefish Town she’s known as “Little Shiang” thanks to her older sister (and successful academic)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Wise Shiang.” She can never seem to measure up to her sister’s accomplishments and is always one step behind. But, Ruiquan has a plan to change her luck—she’s spread rumors around town that there is an ancient tome hidden within the city, which sup- ports every theory she’s spouted so far! Ruiquan’s rumors have embedded themselves in the town so thoroughly that word has even reached the Spirit World of this wonderous tome! Wan Shi Tong has sent his Knowledge Seekers to town in search of the tome and in turn, they’re causing all sorts of mischief through- out the city. Can the PCs uncover what’s going on before the horde of Knowledge Seekers accidentally cause a disaster look- ing for the fake tome?</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Legacy of the Air Nomads</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Knowledge Seekers from the Spirit Library successfully preserved an Airbender training tool taken by the Seekers from the ruins of the Northern Air Temple—although it became inaccessible to humanity after Wan Shi Tong took the library back to the Spirit World. A new Airbender named Gyume discovered a story about some Fire Nation soldiers ready to destroy the tool before a pack of blue-eyed fox spirits stole them away in the night (Gyume is sure these were Knowledge Seekers). Gyume believes that recov- ering this tool would be a great boon to helping to connect the new Air Nation members to the history of the Air Nomads. She pleads with the companions to accompany her on a trip through the Republic City spirit portal to find the library—a quest which Tenzin explicitly forbade.</p>
