<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark88" class="s25">The Fire Nation has experienced a recent shift in leadership after the secret assassination of Fire Lord Azulon. Though Iroh (page 65)</a> was meant to take the throne after his father’s passing,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ozai orchestrated events so that he became Fire Lord instead. Ozai is just as set on world domination as his father and grandfa- ther before him and has sent out his son, Prince Zuko, with the help of Iroh, to hunt down the Avatar. The prince is forbidden to return home until he completes his mission.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now more than ever, the Fire Nation heavily prioritizes its military and industrial power. Its navy and its army have never been stronger, and they occupy much of the Earth Kingdom. There are no signs that Fire Lord Ozai and his military plan to stop their cruel campaigns, and the fates of the Air Nomads and Southern Water Tribe serve as tragic reminders of just what</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Fire Nation is capable of. Much of this history and truth of current events is kept silent within the Fire Islands themselves, where children only learn the glorious history of their country, which paints the Air Nomads as aggressors and the Fire Nation as the peoples who lift other nations up from poverty and chaos. A new generation of Fire Nation citizens have grown up on the lies of the crown, ignorant of what’s really happening outside their borders other than the propaganda they’re regularly fed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While some citizens do not agree with what their nation is doing, a few of them dare to stand against the government, though certainly not openly. To do so would lead to being</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">branded as a traitor and thrown in prison, or worse. People who wish to rebel against Ozai and his government do so in secret, but some objectives cannot be accomplished silently.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Ozai</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The merciless leader of the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ozai was not first in line to become Fire Lord, though he desper- ately longed for the throne and resented his older brother Iroh’s claim to it. Now that Ozai has the throne, he uses his authority to aggressively further the Fire Nation’s century-long quest for world domination. Since taking power, Ozai has spent most of his time ruling from the Royal Palace and surrounding area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ozai is ruthless in matters of revenge, power, and politics. This cruelty is no more evident than how he treats his own family—Ozai is responsible for permanently scarring his son Zuko by burning him on the face, and Ozai threatened his wife by suggesting he would murder Zuko, before she bargained</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for her son’s life and was secretly exiled. He sentences people to exile without a second thought and sends assassins to kill those whose existence merely bothers him. If his citizens create</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">obstacles to his agenda, he does not hesitate to make an example of them. He expects full and undying loyalty from all his subjects and frequently tests that loyalty, even using his servants to spy on his family.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Azula</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A power-hungry member of the Fire Nation royal family</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Azula is the heir to the throne and an adept Firebender known first and foremost for her cruelty and desire for power. As her father’s favorite child, she spends most of her time at the Royal Palace and is an ambitious perfectionist who emulates him in many ways. Azula is as calculating as she is lethal with her firebending powers, which include the ability to lightningbend, and she knows exactly how to manipulate someone’s emotions to make them vulnerable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Azula rarely deems anyone worthy of her time unless they can further her goal of impressing her father. Her two closest friends are Ty Lee and Mai, whom she met at the Royal Fire Academy for Girls. The two friends are very different from Azula; Ty Lee is very upbeat and friendly and Mai comes across as apathetic and gloomy. Even as Azula’s best friends, the two girls aren’t spared her wrath, but they remain loyal to the princess…for now.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commander Zhao</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An ambitious Fire Navy commander bent on climbing to the top <span class="p">Zhao is the commander of a Fire Navy fleet, steadily climbing the ladder of power. He learned firebending from Jeong Jeong before the admiral defected, but only cares for its destructive power rath- er than finding balance and precision through mental discipline.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part16.htm#bookmark57" class="s25">Zhao has an incredible advantage over his rivals; some time ago, he used the Spirit Library in the Si Wong Desert (page 23)</a> to learn the Water Tribes’ weaknesses. He then burned down the section of the library dedicated to the Fire Nation so that no one could learn about the Fire Nation’s vulnerabilities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zhao has enemies and rivals even within the Fire Nation as evidenced by his loathing of Prince Zuko. If someone has insider knowledge about one of his opponents, he turns on the charm and tries to procure it. Should that not work, he is more than happy to use violent measures to acquire that knowledge instead.</p>

One of his primary sources of technolo- gy right now is the Mechanist (page 63)</a> in the Northern Air Temple. Qin makes regular visits to the temple to check on the Mechanist’s progress and procure his latest inventions. Now that the War Minister has gotten a taste of true ingenuity, Qin’s hunger for innovation is greater than ever. Anyone who has a piece of new technology is in danger of attracting his attention, and he will gladly blackmail innocents in order to take it for himself.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jeong Jeong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A legendary firebending Fire Navy defector</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part19.htm#bookmark62" class="s25">Jeong Jeong is an ex-Fire Nation admiral and a firebending teach- er who has become something of a legend. When he defected, he moved to the Earth Kingdom where he now travels with a small tribe of followers. He is an incredibly skilled Firebender who is fully aware of firebending’s destructive potential and how it can be used to devastating effect. He has sworn never to teach firebending again after seeing students use his teachings toward gruesome ends. Zhao is the most destructive of those students, and he looks down on his former teacher for turning his back on the Fire Nation. Jeong Jeong is also a reclusive member of the Order of the White Lotus (page 30).</a> He can be difficult to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">track down since he never stays in one place for long for fear of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">being captured by the Fire Nation.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chey</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A cheerful Fire Nation defector with explosives skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chey is an ex-Fire Nation captain who questioned using his explo- sives expertise to destroy Earth Kingdom villages and defected.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He reveres Jeong Jeong and uses his expertise to thwart the Fire Nation rather than serving it. Chey dutifully follows his mentor everywhere he goes and practically worships the older deserter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Chey is much more outgoing and hopeful than Jeong Jeong, which is a source of tension between the two. Chey believes he can still actively make the world a better place. He is more than willing to lend out his skills if it means protecting the innocent.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of mercenaries who attack the vulnerable</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Rough Rhinos are an elite group of Fire Nation soldiers who ride komodo-rhinos led by a Firebender called Colonel Mongke. The Colonel’s ruthless, intelligent nature makes him exceedingly dangerous. Where other leaders may care about their soldiers, Mongke only cares about himself and isn’t afraid to lose some people if it means he survives. Anyone unlucky enough to encoun- ter this group of soldiers has a nasty fight on their hands, as the Rough Rhinos are known for their brutality. If anyone stands in defense of a vulnerable Earth Kingdom village the Rough Rhinos target, Colonel Mongke takes it as a personal challenge and won’t rest until that village lies in ruins.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Iroh</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part17.htm#bookmark58" class="s28">Iroh is a decorated war general and was first in-line to inherit the Fire Nation throne before his brother Ozai. As a young man, Iroh proved himself worthy to the dragons Ran and Shaw (page 25)</a> who taught him to Firebend without hatred or aggression. In order to protect them, he told everyone he killed the last dragon earning him the ti- tle, ‘The Dragon of the West’. Iroh was also clever enough to watch Waterbenders’ techniques and adapt them to redirect lightning through his body, proving he not only has a keen mind, but ample wisdom.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark82" class="s28">Iroh lost his son Lu Ten during the 600-day Siege of Ba Sing Se (page </a>58). This irrevocably changed him and when his father died shortly after, Iroh left the throne to Ozai. Iroh travelled the world for a time, becoming a member of the White Lotus on his journey, before even- tually returning to the Fire Nation capital and becoming the guide of his nephew Zuko. Iroh is currently travelling the world with Zuko, who has been tasked by his father Ozai to find the Avatar. Iroh is dedicated to Zuko and little could pull him away from helping him. Zuko is ag-</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">gressive and abrasive to anyone who gets in his way. That said, if Iroh’s attention could be diverted for a short time, the only things the old man asks for to share his wisdom are a warm cup of tea and a good conversation.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bitter Rivalry</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Morals Being Tested</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many soldiers and officers in the Fire Nation military see the war as an excellent chance to prove themselves and advance in the ranks. This often means competing with peers for a posi- tion or assignment, and this competition can get dirty. Officers may frame others for their mistakes, and soldiers might engage in contests that measure who can do the most damage to an Earth Kingdom village they’re raiding. Lifelong friends turn against each other when a tempting enough prize is on the table, especially if that prize means escaping the more grueling parts of war. One person might even start a rivalry with somebody who doesn’t want anything to do with it, but it’s hard not to partici- pate if your reputation and well-being are on the line.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do Not Question the Fire Lord</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Survival and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Ozai is the supreme leader of the Fire Nation, and that means that his word is the law. Advisors who push back against his decrees end up exiled or assassinated, and military officials reluctant to follow through on his orders are replaced in the blink of an eye. Anyone under the Fire Lord’s employ who wants to rebel must be exceedingly smart, and at least a little bit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">paranoid, to not get caught. The Fire Lord’s spies are everywhere and no one can be truly trusted.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This influence extends to all Fire Nation strongholds; no one is safe from scrutiny. Those who do transgress face pun- ishments based on the severity of their actions. A person who merely questions the Fire Lord’s decisions may get off with a stern warning, but should that person openly question the Fire Lord again, a prison cell may be waiting for them. Those who dare to act against his interests or openly defy his wishes face even steeper consequences.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Silent Rebellion</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Hope in Rebellion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outside the Fire Islands, Fire Nation officers exert their control over the colonies. While a few officers may act as benevolent rulers, many are power-hungry warlords exerting an iron fist over their population. While these overlords take orders from commanding officers, and in turn the Fire Lord, many are left to their own devices to rule as they see fit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">However, this disconnect from the rule of the Fire Nation also means more room for people to rebel against unjust rule. Secrecy and subterfuge are necessary elements when it comes to fighting the Fire Nation. Those lucky enough to find like-minded individuals must figure out how to meet and communicate with- out getting caught, and should they get caught, they will need a plan of escape.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playing a Fire Nation Character</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players who create Fire Nation PCs in this era encounter a unique problem—the Fire Nation and its armies are a dangerous threat to the world. How can a player create a heroic PC from a nation led by such an unbalanced regime?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NO NATION IS A MONOLITH</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">First, keep in mind that the Fire Nation consists of people with different desires, drives, and beliefs. Some of those people are truly dangerous, like the Fire Lord and his daughter. But most of those people aren’t monsters—some aren’t even aware of their nation’s true crimes! Others are trying to stop the war, whether through rebellion or diplomacy. For every Fire Nation zealot, committed en- tirely to Ozai’s purposes, there is a Fire Nation hero, ready to stand against their own nation to protect others.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Players looking to play Fire Nation characters should always emphasize this diversity. Just because the Fire Nation military and elites are pursuing the Hundred Year War doesn’t mean that every Fire Nation citizen is on board. Rebels, freedom fighters, peace advocates, conscientious objectors, and more are all great options for Fire Nation characters in this era.</p>

</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DISCOVERY AS AN ARC</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Fire Nation PCs in the Hundred Year War Era, the discovery</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">of the extent of the Fire Nation’s crimes creates a compelling arc. <i>Av- atar Legends </i>heroes are always good people at heart; a PC from the Fire Nation who comes to see all the harm the Fire Nation has done and continues to do must confront that pain.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Fire Nation PC might encounter the truth in the inciting incident</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">of your game, coming to realize the truth of the Fire Nation’s cruel pol- icies as they encounter new perspectives and make new friends. This discovery sets up an arc for the PC in which they must grapple with their relationship to their home culture. But don’t create a PC who doesn’t already understand the Fire Nation’s crimes. Discovering the truth in the inciting incident is fine; discovering the truth during play means the PC might not find a path forward as a hero.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">REDEMPTION AS AN ARC</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Fire Nation PCs in the Hundred Year War Era might also aim for redemption arcs in which they were somewhat complicit in their nation’s crimes. A discovery arc is easier; a character who didn’t realize their mistake, but immediately sets out to correct it is one that’s easily recognizable as a hero. A character who instead partic- ipated in the terrible behavior, but now seeks to make up for it, is likely a character with a long road to travel.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part10.htm#bookmark15" class="s28">For any player interested in playing a PC on such a redemptive arc, make sure that the crimes of your PC are not irredeemably hei- nous, and that the other players are comfortable with the story you are establishing (see Safety Tools on page </a>12 for more on how</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">you can check in with the other players).</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Much like with an arc of discovery, any PC on an arc of redemption should already be on that arc at the start of play. If the character hasn’t yet come to realize how wrong they were, and still defends their actions, they aren’t ready to be a heroic PC yet.</p>
