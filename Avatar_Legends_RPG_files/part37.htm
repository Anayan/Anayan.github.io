<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part40.htm#bookmark98" class="s25">Life in the Earth Kingdom is improving since the end of the Hundred Year War, but the nation struggles with decoloniza- tion. Each former Fire Nation colony must figure out what an integrated future looks like for them, and without accepting compromise, there’s no way to make everyone happy. Settle- ments near Yu Dao and Cranefish Town have the opportunity to forge a larger, more diverse community (and later become parts of the United Republic of Nations—see page 82).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One way the Earth Kingdom progresses towards decolo- nization is focusing on technological innovation, which helps to bridge the divide between natives and colonizers. These advancements spell promise for future prosperity, but aren’t</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark90" class="s25">without their own challenges. New divides between benders and non-benders form in the Earth Kingdom as some benders’ jobs are made obsolete by technology (see “Bending Supremacist Uprising,” page 70).</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Earthen Fire Refinery, a crystal refinery, is owned and operated by the world’s first international post-war business: Earthen Fire Industries. In the past, the factory only employed benders to work the production lines because they needed Earthbenders to extract the crystals, Waterbenders to purify them, and Firebenders to heat the ovens. And now thanks to recent mechanical upgrades, non-benders can work alongside benders here. The Earthen Fire Refinery employs so many peo- ple that a settlement named Cranefish Town sprouted up nearby. The Kyoshi Warriors work as the town’s de facto law enforce- ment for the time being.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Toph Beifong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A young earthbending master and pioneer in the art of metalbending <span class="p">Toph Beifong is a living legend and has been known to steal the spotlight even with the Avatar right next to her. Along with being a master Earthbender, Toph is also the first person to discover and hone metalbending. She currently runs Beifong</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Metalbending Academy where she and her students train Earth- benders with the potential to metalbend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though she comes from the aristocratic Beifong family, Toph hates formalities, rituals, and fancy stuff, and loves to say and do whatever she pleases. Toph learned earthbending from badger-moles instead of human teachers, which partly accounts for her unique bending style. Being blind has led her to de- velop a bending-led way to sense people and objects through vibrations in the earth; she can even sense changes in people’s breathing and heartbeats, making her a human lie detector. As- piring benders—especially disabled students seeking a teacher with similar experiences—may seek her out for training because of her unprecedented skill, but she is a tough teacher. When</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">she isn’t at her academy, she is usually off helping the Avatar or working as a representative for Earthen Fire Industries.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lao Beifong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A powerful businessman vested in the future of Cranefish Town</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lao Beifong is the co-founder of Earthen Fire Refinery in Cranefish Town. He is also Toph’s father, though they were estranged until re- cently. Like his daughter, Lao can be stubborn and hardheaded, and he shows his love for Toph by worrying about what’s best for her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lao is a knowledgeable businessman who tries to prioritize the well-being of his employees. Noticing that Cranefish Town was growing rapidly and crime was on the rise, he created the lo- cal Business Council to govern the town. Concerned that bend- ers were using their abilities to rob non-benders, he proposed to outlaw public bending. This fueled the beginnings of the Bender Supremacist Uprising, and while Aang and his allies stopped it, Lao has lingering fears. Now that things have calmed down, he guides aspiring entrepreneurs and does what he can to employ locals looking for work.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Kuei</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 52nd Earth King finally taking a stand for his people</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 52<span class="s48">nd </span>
<a href="part33.htm#bookmark85" class="s25">Earth King spent the vast majority of his life oblivious and sheltered. Long Feng (page 62),</a> the Grand Secretariat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">who manipulated Kuei for many years, is now imprisoned. Kuei, now active in the governance of his city and nation, does his best to improve the Earth Kingdom and its relations with the other nations. Unfortunately, he overcompensates for his embarrassing past, such as when he led an army against the Fire Nation colo- nists who didn’t want to leave Yu Dao…fortunately, the Avatar was there to set him on the right path!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kuei’s beloved and pampered pet bear, Bosco, often travels with him, which makes him cut a more flamboyant figure than most kings. Those looking to help the Earth Kingdom recover from the war might seek Kuei out for an assignment. Conversely, heroes who notice Kuei taking an ill-advised path may try to convince him to take another one.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beifong Metalbending Academy</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The world’s first metalbenders</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Beifong Metalbending Academy is located near Yu Dao in what used to be a firebending dojo during the occupation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Toph Beifong had a rocky start with her first three students, their progress shows promise for the future of metal- bending. Those first three students—Ho Tun, Penga, and The Dark One—now teach classes at the academy. Ho Tun can</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be a bit anxious at times, the young Penga is working through obsessive habits, and The Dark One’s first true love is poetry, but all three are capable Earthbenders with metalbending abilities, and each is dedicated to helping where they are needed. They even assisted in the Southern Reconstruction Project (page</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark90" class="s25">70)</a> in the South Pole. Because metalbending is still a newly discovered form of bending, anyone in need of an Earthbender with metalbending training must come to the academy. Though the number of students is growing, it’s often Ho Tun, Penga, and The Dark One who get sent out on missions.</p>

<a name="bookmark94">Kyoshi Warriors</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of female warriors working as Cranefish Town’s police force <a href="part21.htm#bookmark64" class="s25">Avatar Kyoshi (page </a>
<span class="p">32) founded the Kyoshi Warriors for the purpose of protecting Yokoya Peninsula (now Kyoshi Island). The warriors dress in green armor, metal headdresses, and makeup that resembles what Kyoshi wore during her time. They also often wield specialized war fans in battle. After aiding in</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the Hundred Year War, they expanded their role as protectors and acted as Fire Lord Zuko’s bodyguards for some time. One of their most recent endeavors has been training the police in Cranefish Town, where a group of them still reside.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark87" class="s25">Suki, a young woman who began her training at eight years old, currently leads the Kyoshi Warriors. In addition to fighting with the standard Kyoshi war fans, she has also learned chi-blocking, thanks to Ty Lee (page 64),</a> who is now also a Kyoshi Warrior</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and has shared her chi-blocking mastery with many other war- riors. The group is entirely made up of women, except for Sokka, Suki’s boyfriend, who was briefly an honorary member.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bending Supremacists</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of extremists who believe benders are inherently superior <span class="p">Though the bender supremacist uprising was quelled, some peo- ple still feel that benders are superior to non-benders and worry about machines replacing benders in the workplace. Liling, the leader of the bending supremacist movement in Cranefish Town, believed non-benders should not hold positions of power as they are inherently weaker. Despite her best efforts to start a war—and to kill her daughter, Ru, for abandoning the cause to side with the Avatar—Liling failed and now resides in Cranefish Town’s prison, though she may be moved to a more secure location soon.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Cranefish Town was the seat of this bigotry-fueled conflict, but people throughout the Earth Kingdom and the rest of the world share the same ideas about the superiority of benders. Bending supremacists sabotage factories where benders have lost jobs to machines and carry out attacks on non-benders in power, giving the heroes ample opportunity to foil their plans if they know what to look out for.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yu Dao is not the only town with a mix of Fire Nation colonists and Earth Kingdom citizens living there, and not everyone agrees about what these towns should look like from here on out. Colonists who decide (or are pressured) to move back</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the Fire Nation may not have lived there since they were children; others have never lived there. Young people with one parent from the Earth Kingdom and one from the Fire Nation may feel their loyalties do not lie with any single nation, but with their unique mixed community. Diverse settlements like Crane- fish Town are attractive to citizens looking for belonging that isn’t dependent on being accepted by any one nation. However, they may also attract unwanted attention from people who don’t believe cultures should mix.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So much was lost during the war. Some refugees stay in Ba Sing Se’s Lower Ring and others move back to the villages they evacuat- ed—if those villages still stand. Rebuilding pillaged villages isn’t only a physically laborious task, but an emotionally taxing one as well. Some people have lingering unanswered questions about the fates of loved ones they were separated from during the war. A few may find closure by confirming a loved one’s death or reuniting with them, but others must choose between devoting themselves to hunting down answers they may never find or moving forward without those answers. Heroes may want to embark on an epic journey to track down a friend who went missing during the war or stay close to home to fight off bandits taking advantage of their recovering village. They may even want revenge against a friend who betrayed them in the heat of battle to save their own skin.</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Growing Pains</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For refugees living in the Lower Ring, the end of the war hasn’t brought much in the way of relief. The area is still overcrowded, and the government does not provide enough resources to the citizens who live there. Those in the Lower Ring may feel forgot- ten as the rest of the world starts to heal. Some of the problems that plague the Lower Ring include poverty, crime, poor sanita- tion, and overcrowding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though the corruption in the government is better since Long Feng was deposed, the Lower Ring is still a vulnerable target for crime bosses and government officials alike who take advantage of this chaotic time. Heroes who want to spend some time in the Lower Ring have plenty to keep them occupied between all the growing criminal organizations. It’s also a great place for someone to go into hiding.</p>
