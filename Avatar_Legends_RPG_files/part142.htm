<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While a path is laid out for your players to follow, <b>Ash &amp; Steel </b>is open for them to do whatever and go wherever they like. As a GM, you have many tools to ensure everyone at the table still has fun and the plot unfolds around the heroes. This section includes various tools you can use to center your adventure if things don’t go according to plan and to continue your adven- ture if players want more!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each location in this adventure has a suggested escalation, but based on what your players decide to do, the allies they make, or which problems they tackle, the suggested escalation might not make sense or might not be enough to get you through the adventure. These escalations can be used if the conflicts start to falter, to reveal new information about the situation, and to add action to the scenes. Some escalations will provide new infor- mation, which may make the players question their actions, and other escalations can purely be an opportunity for action. Here are some examples:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Looking for Onomu, the Rough Rhinos attack the location the players are in. The Rhinos destroy buildings and hurt innocent bystanders. They have a specific goal, but they show no restraint, especially if they have picked upon the fact that Onomu is traveling with companions who might interfere with this kind of destruction. If nothing is done, they totally destroy the location and leave in frustration.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Armadillo-Bears arrive at a location looking for Onomu and clash with a group of Fire Nation soldiers passing through the area, as Ben Ta purposefully picks a fight. The two forces are relatively evenly matched at the moment; no clear victor emerges before both sides are tired. If nothing is done, the soldiers end up capturing an important member of the resistance fighters (for example, Rameh) and then</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">retreating; the Armadillo-Bears don’t realize until too late that someone is missing as they catch their breath and recover.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• An Earth Kingdom citizen wronged by Onomu during her time as a general spots her and confronts her. Onomu will try to stay under the radar and deflate the conflict, but it inevitably grows, especially as Onomu’s own sense of pride is injured by the words thrown at her. A fight breaks out when the citizen throws the first punch, and Onomu eventually tries to use a lash of fire to break up the fight and get the person to back down, likely creating a fire that calls down more attention. If nothing is done, Onomu is arrested (or taken by the Earth Kingdom citizen’s allies) and imprisoned</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• An individual Dai Li agent takes an opportunity, especially in a moment of calm and rest, to try to directly seize the plans from Onomu. They will not wear a uniform so as to hide their true allegiance, but if they use techniques specific to the Dai Li, then their true nature will become apparent quickly. If nothing is done or the agent isn’t stopped, then they steal the plans and start racing back to Ba Sing Se!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Keeping Time</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because each location in this adventure presents your players with a unique obstacle, they may want to spend time focusing on and resolving the issue. This might not be a problem when you’re playing through this adventure with your home group and have the time to devote to a few sessions of play, but it can become a problem if you’re running this game as a one-shot. If that’s the case, make sure you cut right to the action at each new location. In a one-shot play, the hunt for Onomu should feel relentless. The heroes can’t solve the issues at every location… because they don’t have time! Onomu’s enemies will find the group if they’re not quick about things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For a one-shot game, as a result of the tension on the overall mission to deliver Onomu and the plans, it’s very important not to present unsolvable, terrible dilemmas at every single location that the PCs visit. When they are being chased so thoroughly by Armadillo-Bears, Rough Rhinos, and even Dai Li agents, the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PCs won’t want to spend the time to stop and deal with complex issues—doing so seems like a losing proposition—but they</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">also won’t want to leave innocent people in dire straits, seeing as they’re heroes. If every single place they go to has major problems and dilemmas, they will either start to feel terrible for consistently leaving quickly, or they won’t leave quickly and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">they will get bogged down in local events and the attack of their pursuers. In either case, there’s a good chance that the players will come to feel frustrated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, carefully pace the events and dilemmas the PCs encounter at each location if you’re playing a tight, fast one-shot game. The PCs need to arrive at the outpost by the end of your time playing, assuming of course that they don’t decide on a dif- ferent goal. Make sure that they encounter just enough tension to keep things interesting without derailing the arrival at the conclusion of the adventure. You can also always easily decrease the number of intervening locations if that’s necessary for the time in which you’re playing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For a game in a longer campaign, however, or a game in which you can approach the adventure over multiple sessions, take the time to complicate the journey. The pace doesn’t have to be nearly so breakneck, as the PCs might go entire locations without really being under pressure from pursuers. Encounter- ing difficult dilemmas along the way makes the locations that the PCs reach all the more real and vital. After they deliver the plans, they might even return to these locations, especially if there are unresolved problems or places where they might find safety. As</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a result, it becomes all the more important to help these places feel real, complex, and fleshed out, even if that extends the overall journey.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, in a longer game take your cues from the PCs and their interest. If they are particularly invested in certain NPCs or certain difficulties, then make moves related to those characters or problems, bringing them to the fore. And you can always amp up the tension at an appropriate moment by reminding them that they are being pursued by bringing in the Rough Rhinos or the Armadillo-Bears to make a situation more complicated.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Possible Future Adventures</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This adventure may be the beginning of your group’s story but it certainly doesn’t have to be the end! Here are some ideas for</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">continuing your game with the various plot hooks in this adven- ture, well-suited for a longer game.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Rebellion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs choose to slight Long Feng, be it by denying him the plans or through any other means, they will no longer be in his good graces. Considering that Long Feng is functionally in control of the entire Earth Kingdom at this point, and certainly in control of Ba Sing Se, that makes him a powerful antagonist;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a group of PCs facing that much of a threat might decide to just leave the Earth Kingdom and stay away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But much of the time, the PCs are likely to be from parts of the Earth Kingdom, or to have some attachment to the people there, whether just because they’re heroes or because they formed bonds as they navigated the Earth Kingdom. The PCs might choose to fight for those people and the Earth Kingdom as a whole against the oppression and invasion of the Fire Na- tion...and even the oppression of Long Feng!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most significantly, if the PCs did not turn over the plans to Long Feng, then it means they still need to put the plans into the hands of someone who can do something with them. The Fire Nation continues to advance, and those plans might make a real difference in helping the Earth Kingdom avoid the worst of the</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Nation onslaught. The heroes might be able to deliver the plans to a general of the Earth Kingdom or even to new friends in the Armadillo-Bears. The Northern Water Tribe, other rebel groups in the Earth Kingdom, or even some dissident voices inside the Fire Nation all make further potential depositories for this valuable intel. Whoever the PCs choose to leave the plans with, there are countless more stories to tell—they likely need the heroes’ help to fully act on those plans!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs might also take up an active role against the Fire Nation with any of those groups, and especially the Armadil- lo-Bears if the PCs managed to befriend them or help heal Ben</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ta. Doing so will likely keep them away from Long Feng’s direct control, and might even leave them as allies too useful for Long Feng to directly act against, while setting up a whole new string of difficult challenges</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, if Onomu’s still alive after the PCs protect her and keep the plans from Long Feng, she will be an ally, but she will only actively help and aid the PCs with this kind of rebellion against the Fire Nation if they changed her heart. If her primary motivation is still survival, she’ll try to find some part of the Earth Kingdom to quietly hunker down and survive until she can find a better plan, but if the PCs have changed her heart, she might join them in a fight against the invaders—if only just to stop the fighting, not to harm her home country.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">In the Court of the Grand Secretariat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs end in Long Feng’s good graces, they’re now his allies. He will deliver on any reasonable promises he made to the PCs, and he’ll want them to do more for him—if for no other reason than to exert control over them. Long Feng is no fool, and he will genuinely use the PCs to his greatest advantage, using them to achieve real goals. At first, the missions may be reasonable, and the PCs will achieve real good in the Earth Kingdom at large, fighting off Fire Nation invaders. But as time goes on, either they will grow closer and closer to Long Feng—and in turn, he will consider them more loyal—or he will come to un- derstand that they are not actually loyal to him at all, but instead they are loyal to higher ideals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs continue to recommit to Long Feng, then he will come to give them more and more duties that are messy. Instead of battling Fire Nation soldiers, they’ll also be sent to handle a recalcitrant Earth Kingdom general who refuses to toe the line. Instead of protecting a town, they are disarming a rogue group of rebels. This is the perfect time to reincorporate places and characters from this adventure—the Armadillo-Bears might have been doing good work, fighting the Fire Nation, only to have become a thorn in Long Feng’s side for some other reason, and now he would like them to disband. These new tasks slowly reveal the Grand Secretariat’s true face and priorities—to main- tain his power and control of the Earth Kingdom and Ba Sing Se. They will have hard choices ahead of them, and as soon as they prove themselves not entirely loyal to him, he will begin a different tactic...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs show themselves as not utterly loyal to Long Feng</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">above all else, then he will continue to ask them to go on mis- sions...but his goal is to wear them down until they are ultimately dealt with by the dangers of a mission. He will send them on more and more difficult tasks, and the PCs will inevitably be</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">put in a position where their very lives are at stake. Remember, Long Feng considers anybody who’s not his pawn an enemy, and he accepts no challenge to his rule or plans. You can again use the places and issues of this adventure to create these situations, having the PCs directly face off against other antagonists like</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Rough Rhinos in blatantly disadvantageous circumstances, like at the Rough Rhinos’ own base of power! If the PCs survive this kind of intense, life-challenging mission, then they only get assigned another—albeit with Long Feng providing profuse thank yous to them first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What’s more, the PCs may discover others—or even them- selves!—suffering the mental manipulation or brainwashing treatment. As such, the walls of Ba Sing Se soon become a jail rather than a protection, and they may need to find a way to escape before it’s too late.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs decide to fully confront and begin to combat Long Feng and his Dai Li, they will have a real struggle on their hands—one the equal of the rebellion described on the facing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">page. Long Feng is in a position of real power, and while the PCs might not be able to unseat him entirely, they can at least strike real blows for justice throughout the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Other Questions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Here are a few other questions you might have as GM about how to run this adventure successfully, along with advice on how to handle each of them.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What if the PCs don’t want to follow the path? <span class="p">The path of locations as provided here is the safest path available to the PCs on their way to the outpost. That is absolutely, certainly true, no obfuscation or deception. If the PCs want the safest path, the one least likely to cause them trouble, it’s the one laid out in this adventure. Emphasize this to the PCs—the only reason to devi- ate from the path as presented here is because they have decided that something besides safety matters deeply to them. If they want to accomplish the mission as quickly and safely as possible, then this is the path they should be following, end of story.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing a one-shot and the PCs truly want to deviate from this path, you can follow them to their new chosen destina- tions, imposing harsher costs (inflicting fatigue and conditions) to represent how the path is unsafe, while still keeping their pur- suers at their tails. The intent here isn’t to punish them, but to respect the fiction that says this path is inherently less safe, and to still provide a tense, dramatic conclusion—their opposition follows them so they can have one final conflict!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing a longer game with multiple sessions, you can follow the PCs to these new locations, but again, emphasize the dangers of the alternative path they are tracing. Be it foes, costs like fatigue and conditions, or something else, by choosing to deviate from the path as presented here, the PCs are choosing to take on some risk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In general, however, the most important aspect here is to really interrogate why the PCs want to deviate from the path. If they’re no longer actually trying to deliver Onomu and the plans to Long Feng, then that’s a different issue entirely!</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">What if the PCs don’t want to deliver the plans and Onomu to Long Feng? <span class="p">At the beginning of the adventure, the PCs all have their own reasons for committing to the mission, not least because Long Feng promised them something. All of the PCs, even those who have reason to doubt Long Feng, are committed enough to the mission at the beginning that they shouldn’t reconsider until the situation has changed dramatical- ly. But after the PCs are attacked by a Dai Li agent, or hear more about Long Feng, or change Onomu’s heart, or befriend the Armadillo-Bears...they may no longer think that delivering the plans to Long Feng is the best option.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">In this case, follow them to where they think they should</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deliver the plans, with all their pursuers hot on their heels! Just because they don’t deliver the plans to Long Feng, that doesn’t mean they’re suddenly free. The Rough Rhinos will still be after them, as will the Armadillo-Bears, and as soon as Long Feng hears what the PCs have decided, he will dispatch a group of Dai Li agents after them! Considering that Long Feng has ears everywhere, that won’t take too long, either.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can still aim toward an impressive final confrontation, somewhere else, perhaps with the aid of local peoples the PCs have helped. Make sure to provide some answer to the question of why their pursuers would stop hounding the PCs, however, whether it’s because everyone believes the plans were burned, or because everyone believes the PCs are dead.</p>
