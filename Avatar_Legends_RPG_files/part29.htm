<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Roku Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Water Tribes are reexamining their role in the world, strug- gling to find a path true to their traditions as the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom rapidly expand their reach—all while the spirits in the polar regions grow agitated and aggressive. Many suspect that these changes within the Spirit World are because of the rapid industrialization happening all over the world and seek to quell the spirits before it is too late.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many tribespeople also now believe the tribes should look outward, traveling to the other nations more frequently to trade with allies or even attempting to gain control of important ship- ping routes; others seek to follow the model of the Air Nomads by avoiding direct conflict in favor of living in harmony on traditional lands. Yet, no one in the tribes can deny the world is changing around them—both Southern chieftain Qanitt and Northern chief Skiri propose new ideas for the future of the tribes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Qanitt is a popular Southern chieftain who wants to secure political ties through peaceful means and cooperation. They see the signs of the spirits’ agitation and believe it’s important to gain allies as soon as possible. They want to open up stronger relationships with other nations, especially taking advantage of the tribes’ resources and crafts to create trade connections with the others. In contrast, Skiri believes other nations have taken enough from the tribes. Foreigners patrol the waters with aban- don and ignore the outcry from the spirits. The Northern chief believes the tribes should meet the other nations on their own terms—aggression and battle—as it seems the only way to get the other nations to listen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Despite the disagreements between the North and South,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">communication between the two is open and fruitful. Though on opposite sides of the world, both work with one another for mutu- al benefit. They’ve so far been willing to put any internal disagree- ment aside to present a united front on the international stage.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qanitt</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Southern Water Tribe chieftain looking to grow the economy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qanitt is the cool-headed chieftain of the prominent city of Whale Harbor in the Southern Water Tribe. They’re a modernist who looks to facilitate the two tribes working in harmony, joining together on political and economic programs that benefit both.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They’ve made several trips to the North to try to establish plans for economic expansion—they’re convinced the two Tribes can only stand against the agitated spirits and the encroaching reach of the other nations together. But Qanitt acknowledges a need for a secure source of resources, such as ore and trading partners, to do so. To that end the chieftain searches for heroes who can help them peacefully secure these resources, either by forging new shipping routes or opening up new agreements between the tribes and trading partners. In return Qanitt offers support to allies who’ve proven their loyalty, and as a person with significant popularity in the South, this is valuable indeed.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Skiri</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Northern Water Tribe chief who wants to seize power for the Tribes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Skiri is the forceful chief of the Northern Water Tribe. He is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25">convinced that the Tribes should engage the conflicts of the day, seizing control of trade routes and imposing fees on those Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom ships traveling via open water. He isn’t against Qanitt’s proposals for more cooperation, but he believes the Tribes need to aggressively protect what is theirs before seeking more international cooperation. His proposals are controversial, and he has resorted to blackmail and threats to advance his cause. He pushed the hardest for at- tacking the Earth Kingdom after the earthquake (page </a>46), but cooler heads prevailed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though a popular leader at home, Skiri has lost international allies by often speaking out against the Earth King, who many see as harmless. Skiri is willing to pay good money to any person who can get him intel on the Earth Kingdom’s movements and plans.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Makittuq</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A powerful Waterbender with a deep connection to spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Makittuq is a tall woman with a broad, warm smile. A powerful bender of the Northern Water Tribe, Makittuq has always felt isolated from others, more in touch with the spirits than people. From a young age she knew she was assigned the wrong gender at birth; when her family rejected her need to live openly as her true identity, she found solace in interacting with spirits who understood her true self. As the spirits have become agitated, Makittuq has taken it upon herself to develop her rare water- bending ability to calm spirits thrown out of balance. She lives near the edge of a large spirit forest and does her best to keep Dark Spirits from attacking Agna Qel’a and other settlements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">She’s happy for assistance from heroes also looking for ways</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to maintain balance with the spirits and will teach any worthy Waterbender how to heal others regardless of their gender.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tiqriganiannig</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A wealthy merchant looking to expand her reach</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tiqriganiannig (or Tiq), the richest person in the South, made her fortune shipping Southern textiles and art throughout the Earth Kingdom. She avidly supports Qanitt’s efforts to expand the Tribe’s economic reach, proudly reminding anyone who listens that her imports regularly inspire the newest fashion trends in the Earth Kingdom. Tiq isn’t shy about throwing her money around either. She’s even financially supporting “freedom fighters” in the Earth Kingdom who hope to unseat Earth King Jialun. After all, taxes on her shipments could be a lot lower with someone else in charge!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Heroes could run into Tiq anywhere her ships carry goods. Happy to rope anyone competent into her employ, she is cur- rently looking for people to help guard the Grand Tour of the <i>Unity </i>

<a name="bookmark78">Taqukaq</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Roku’s waterbending master</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taqukaq is the Northern waterbending master who taught Avatar Roku waterbending. He initially refused to train Roku, believing that any Fire Nation subject would hold a higher loyalty to the Fire Lord than the people of the Four Nations. However, Roku refused to seek another instructor and eventual- ly convinced Taqukaq of his devotion by living in the North for several years.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Waterbender is a kind, soft-spoken man with an innate charisma and force of personality. He uses these gifts to perform diplomatic missions for the Water Tribes…along with a bit of covert espionage along the way. He spends his time between the Fire Nation and Northern Water Tribe investigating allegations that the Fire Nation has stolen Tribe technology. Taqukaq is wary of any person willing to selflessly help him with his mission, but accepts help from those who prove their motivations earnest.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Massak</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A master boatwright wary of the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part27.htm#bookmark74" class="s25">Massak is a master boatwright of the Southern Water Tribe. Her work with Nyn Chei (page 49)</a> was pivotal in the develop- ment of the Fire Nation’s fleet, but Massak saw her design was used to create a defensive patrol ship, rather than a trade ship that could swiftly reach the Water Tribes as promised. Nyn and Massak have not spoken for years, and Massak now regrets the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aid she provided her former lover and design partner—although she still misses Nyn dearly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25">Currently, Massak is being courted by Earth Kingdom recruiters, looking to have her as a guest lecturer in Ba Sing Se’s Royal Learning Hall. Despite her suspicions after hearing ru- mors of what happened to the Earth Sages (page 46),</a> Massak is considering the offer; her insatiable curiosity might still get the best of her. Perhaps by accepting the position, she can un- ravel whatever scheme the Earth Kingdom has cooked up. She’s currently looking for allies willing to join her in digging deeper into the Earth King’s secrets…</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sacred Island</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Testing Alliances</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This halfway point between the Water Tribes, off the coast of the Earth Kingdom, has spiritual and cultural significance to both the North and South. For thousands of years any severe disputes between the two Tribes were brought to this island, and chiefs make a voyage to the island at least once in their careers to pay respect to the land.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">On one such voyage, a Southern chieftain by the name of Tana was surprised to find Fire Nation ships docked on the island. Through political channels Northern chief Skiri learned the Fire Nation now claims the island as their own. Skiri is ready to send a majority of his fleet to reclaim the island, but needs support from the Southern chieftains. So far the chieftains hav- en’t come to a consensus on what to do as many are unwilling to start an all-out war with the Fire Nation.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25">The waters between the Northern Water Tribe and the Earth Kingdom contain valuable fishing grounds and waterways leading into both the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation. The Northern Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom have been embroiled in a conflict for control of the waterways, which came to a head after a devastating tsunami (page 46).</a> After Avatar Roku stepped in and Air Nomads arrived to help keep the peace, the conflict quieted for a time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">However, the governor of Chenbao has demanded taxes on Water Tribe merchant ships who use the northern passage, though there is no practical way to enforce this. The merchant</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ships have avoided the taxes with their sailing mastery, but any goods they sell in the Earth Kingdom are now contraband—and the governor hopes this move escalates the situation, as he peti- tions the Earth King for military assistance enforcing his tax.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angered Spirits</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Resources and Industrialization</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bands of dark spirits now rage through the wilderness in both the North and South. Some remote villages have been attacked by these spirits, hurting people and damaging homes. Members of both tribes are worried, because though they’ve kept the spirits appeased for now, it is only a matter of time before the situation becomes untenable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most spiritually-focused tribespeople feel not only a deep sense of duty to the spirits, but to the rest of the world to ensure things remain peaceful for everyone. Some scholars and spiritual leaders believe this increase of spiritual activity is linked to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the various nations extending their reach and abusing natural resources for technological advancement. With the Fire Nation laying claim to Water Tribe sacred land and hunting dragons, and the Earth Kingdom displacing spirits in their search for nat- ural resources, no wonder the spirits in the world are in chaos.</p>
