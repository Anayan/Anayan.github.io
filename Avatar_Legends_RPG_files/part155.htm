<a name="bookmark365">The Clock</a>
<a name="bookmark299">&zwnj;</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just as the heroes in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legend of Korra </i>must solve problems creatively, the player characters (PCs) in this adventure must use their own creativity and wit to find Varrick and discover the truth behind his disappearance. <b>The pressure to find Varrick is represented by an eight-part clock. </b>Every time a part of the clock is filled, precious time</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">passes, applying more pressure on the PCs<b>. If the clock reaches its end, then it’s too late—the bombs go off, and Varrick is flung from the facility where he strikes his head and loses his memory! </b>The companions might be able to later find evidence of San Ho’s conspiracy or rescue Varrick, but it’s going to take time, more investigation, and a whole new adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM marks one segment of the clock when either of the following occurs:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs take a significant amount of time to do something—for example, carefully following a Triad member through the winding streets of the city or spending time searching an area for clues.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs travel to a new location—for example, moving from Varrick’s offices to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the water treatment plan where he’s kept by Triad goons.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The ticking of the clock represents an hour or two passing and the pressure mounting on the PCs. Ticking the next seg- ment of the clock only has to do with time passing, not the exact action the PCs take—the clues they find in a location don’t matter to the ticking clock, but the time they spend searching does. GMs should use time (and the ticking of a segment) as a common cost or complication for PCs’ moves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For every two segments marked, a new event occurs that pushes the situation to greater tension.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Event 1—After two segments are ticked</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the day turns from later morning to midday, the journalist <b>Wáahlaal </b>catches up to the PCs and interrogates them for a scoop. Someone in President Moon’s office tipped her off to the PCs’ investigation, and she’s been tracking them ever since. She will ask the players what they know and maybe be a little helpful—providing some details about Republic City’s politics and crime—if only to further her cause. She will continue to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">follow the players throughout the rest of the adventure and may become an issue during some future encounter.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Event 2—After four segments are ticked</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The afternoon wanes when the PCs find themselves confronted by henchmen from the Terra Triad, commanded by Wei Tia.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a stalling tactic by San Ho as he cannot move Varrick to the water treatment facility until nightfall. Wei Tia participates in the fight, but his heart isn’t in it; he’ll try to escape the instant things start to turn. A PC who fights with Wei Tia can pick up on his hesitation and reluctance—he generally tries to <span class="s11">evade and observe </span>or <span class="s11">defend and maneuver</span>, and using Test Balance against him will reveal a sense of this hesitation along with his principle.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Event 3—After six segments are ticked</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The late afternoon sun casts its final golden glow of the day as night begins to fall. Around this time, the Triad members reach the water treatment facility with Varrick in tow, planting the bombs. Meanwhile, Wei Tia sends a messenger to ask the PCs to meet him at a neutral location so they can talk. If the PCs ask, the kid identifies Wei Tia as a lieutenant of the Terra Triad. Traveling there will, of course, tick another segment. If the PCs meet with Wei Tia, they recognize the face of the man they fought earlier in the day. He begins cautiously, making sure the PCs don’t attack him but keeping his guard up. He offers them information and aid at any point over the conversation if any of the following occurs:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs have proven or can prove that their hearts are with the people of the city, the people Wei Tia would try to protect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Wei Tia’s balance reaches +3 Community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs agree to the bargain he would ask for—that he and the Triad be left out of any evidence or testimony provided to the authorities, and be left more or less unharmed by the PCs’ further actions.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If none of the above are true, he gives them a warning to stay out of it—something of a threat, but also a statement that getting involved can only make things worse for them and for others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The information and aid Wei Tia offers are more or less a full explanation. Wei Tia will tell the PCs about the plan, that the bombs are set in the water treatment facility, and that Varrick</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is being moved there, but only if he believes the cause is worth putting the Triad at risk, or if the PCs assure him that Triad members will not be harmed. Wei Tia wants to tell the PCs be- cause he wants them to intercede and solve the situation, but he is still reluctant to cross San Ho. If pushed too hard, he may back off entirely, and he certainly won’t do anything like going with the PCs to fight against other Triad members.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Event 4—After eight segments are ticked</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The bombs go off! The Triad members leave the facility along with San Ho, after he takes one last moment to gloat to Varrick’s face. In the time between when San Ho and the Triad members leave and when the bombs go off, Varrick finally manages to get himself free and runs just far enough to be flung by the explosion into the water, where he conks his head and loses his memory! If the PCs are on their way to the water treatment facility when the eighth segment is ticked, they pass the Triad members, Steely Ning, and San Ho leaving in their trucks. San Ho quickly realizes what’s happening and orders Steely Ning to go after the PCs, which she reluctantly does. The PCs arrive at the facility with minutes to spare before the bombs goes off—they’ll have to move quickly to save Varrick or stop the bombing, all while the Terra Triad tries to stop them one last time!</p>
