<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire &amp; Brimstone <span class="p">takes place during the Four Nations Summit &amp; Technological Symposium, a gathering of diplomats and scien- tists from around the world. The summit is held at </span>Zoryu Hall<span class="p">,</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a center of learning in eastern Hari Bulkan. Hari Bulkan itself is a wealthy city surrounding the Fire Nation’s Royal Palace in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">caldera of a volcano. The city stands in contrast to the more work- ing-class Harbor City, located at the base of the volcano.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While the summit’s daily meetings and exhibitions take place within Zoryu Hall, the delegates themselves are housed nearby in <b>Tako Dormitory</b>, which serves as a place of rest and informal chats between attendees.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Beyond the hall and dorms, the PCs will be acquainted with <b>the summit storehouse</b>, a nearby storage building redesigned to house whatever items were too heavy or bulky to be carried by hand by the delegations that brought them to Hari Bulkan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Zoryu Hall</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Part school, part meeting hall, and part auditorium, Zoryu Hall was named in honor of Fire Lord Zoryu. Although most of the building is taken up by a giant lecture hall, the building also has a full assortment of smaller rooms for meetings and classes.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Twisting Dragons</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This 10-foot-tall metal sculpture made by master artist Fusei depicts a pair of dragons rising from the ground, spiraling around each other. In addition to the statue’s intimidating beauty, each of the dragons briefly breathes flames at the top of each hour. Any fights that take place in front of this fountain</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">run the danger of either setting something aflame or, worse yet, exploding the fountain.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Meeting Rooms</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because the summit runs continuously during daytime hours, the PCs can find most of the delegates in the meeting rooms during the day. If the heroes want, they can sit in on any of the meetings, where delegates talk about a variety of topics such as the spiritual and environmental impacts of industrialization, the possibility of a joint moon observatory, and political alliances. <b>Note: </b>The talks in these meetings aren’t the actual focus of the adventure. Rather than playing through a scene only about the meeting, either summarize what the PC hears and move on, or have an exciting plot-relevant event interrupt the lecture to drive the story forward.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Tearoom</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An important part of Zoryu Hall, the tearoom is a natural gathering point. High walls hung with bright red lanterns and numerous paintings of pastoral landscapes frame scholars carry- ing on debates from the lectures and challenging one another’s ideas. Any hero looking to stall someone while their compatriots search the delegate’s room would be wise to do so here.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Tako Dormitory</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The dormitory is a square three-level building with a lush garden in the center, one of the larger government buildings in this part of Hari Bulkan. Although some of the Fire Nation delegates live in the city, they all live and work out of Tako Dormitory during the summit. For the delegates, the dorms serve as their political embassy, office, and personal quarters. Although all negotiations are technically supposed to take place in Zoryu Hall, everyone present understands that some of the most important conversa- tions will take place in the dormitory, over a cup of tea or a game of Pai Sho.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ground Floor</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ground floor houses the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom delegates. <b>Pohu’s room </b>contains drafts of various pieces of innovative winter survival gear and ship components. It also contains a hidden document speculating about how to use me- teorite metal to improve ships. During the day, <b>Taqukaq’s room </b>houses climbing equipment and lock picks. Taqukaq leaves each evening to spy on the Fire Nation. <b>Ikru’s room </b>has a pile of notebooks, most of which have 10–20 seemingly random pages filled with stream-of-consciousness notes. A clever PC might be able to <b>assess the situation </b>or <b>rely on skills and training </b>to realize that these have hidden messages—potentially implicating Ikru as the thief.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Garden</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The garden in the middle of the dormitory houses some of the Fire Nation’s rarest plants and most aggressive gardeners.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the garden is meticulously preened, it’s a place of quiet serenity for anyone looking for some peace amid the hectic meetings. Some delegates, especially Sumati, have private meet- ings here.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">First Floor</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once full of busy offices, this floor is now the cafeteria, which serves a wide variety of meals four times a day. Khuchtei and Ikru take all of their meals here, making sure to hobnob with everyone else but avoiding each other. Ikru offers games of Pai Sho and tea.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Second Floor</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The top floor, this is the temporary home for the Air Nomad and Fire Nation delegates. In <b>Khuchtei’s room </b>are dossiers on each of the other delegates and possibly the heroes. She also has a report containing what she knows about the properties of me- teorite metal. During the night, she can be found here, as well as on the first floor. <b>Sumati’s room </b>seems less lived-in than would be expected, and she has very few belongings. Hong’s room adjoins Khuchtei’s; hidden within Hong’s quarters is a makeup kit. If he’s the thief, he also has stolen documents from other rooms and delegates, including some concerning the properties of meteorite metal.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Summit Storehouse</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The workers in the summit storehouse often joke about its underwhelming name, “the storehouse,” humorous when their nation is so often one for gallant pageantry. In reality, the bland name was applied simply because no one wanted their name associated with the building—around a dozen disasters have destroyed all or part of the building at various times, and it’s believed to be cursed or at least have bad luck.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The modern storehouse has stood for over a decade sur- rounded by a paved avenue that allows workers to get in or out quickly. Although it stands nearly 50 feet tall to accommodate the strange contraptions, it’s a single-story structure, a rarity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the space-starved Hari Bulkan. As the closest warehouse to Tako Dormitory and Zoryu Hall, organizers hastily partitioned the building into equal sections. This way, each delegation re- ceives the same amount of space to store their various supplies, equipment, exhibits, and other items (as well as their crates and packing materials). The partitions are made of sturdy wood and Fire Nation guards regularly patrol the area to prevent thefts.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The various partitions are as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Fire Nation’s area is relatively sparse, with only spare parts for the Twisting Dragon sculpture and the sculpture’s empty crate. Hidden inside the crate is a notebook listing everything the other nations brought in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Air Nomads’ storage has a small offering plate that Sumati uses to present food to Rust. It also has a crate full of moon peach cakes, which Sumati planned on presenting to the delegations at the end of the summit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Southern Water Tribe’s room has a notebook filled with extensive information about Taqukaq, in Pohu’s handwriting. It covers the exact same points as Khuchtei’s dossier on Taqukaq.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Northern Water Tribe’s section has empty crates, one of which has a logbook of Taqukaq’s spying hidden in a false panel of the crate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The Earth Kingdom’s room has several carts and sleds, which they used to move their sculptures and contraptions into Zoryu Hall.</p>
