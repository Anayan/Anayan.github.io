</p>
<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">kyoshi era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom is Avatar Kyoshi’s home, and during this era the considerable unrest in the kingdom is intensifying. Outlaws fight both amongst themselves and with law enforcement, and the Earth Kingdom government is unable to protect all its citi- zens. The kingdom’s remote villages are the most vulnerable, as they hold little importance to the Earth Kingdom’s economy and are therefore not protected.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This issue was exemplified by Zigan Village, a settlement in the northwest of the kingdom brought to the brink of ruin because of the Earth Kingdom’s lack of oversight and terrible</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mismanagement by the teenage Governor Te Sihung. The village nearly fell to an avoidable famine because Te followed in his father’s footsteps, confiscating grain from locals and selling it for his own profit. Fortunately, Kyoshi solved this issue by making the governor promise to do better moving forward, but not all villages are so lucky.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Like the outlying villages, the Earth Kingdom’s cities face their own challenges. Prosperous cities must contend with <i>daofei </i>interference and engrained political corruption. In particular,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part16.htm#bookmark56" class="s25">Ba Sing Se (page 22)</a> is home to numerous <i>daofei </i>groups in- cluding several former Yellow Necks. The farther from the center of the city you are, the less security there is, and those who live in the Lower Ring know all too well that they are on their own when it comes to dealing with the <i>daofei</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kirima</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A confident waterbending teacher and professional criminal <span class="p">Kirima is Kyoshi’s waterbending teacher and a loyal member of the Flying Opera Company. Though she has some rough edges,</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">she cares deeply about the other members of the company. She is supremely confident in her skills as a fighter and a performer, and it is difficult to intimidate her. Though she has a long criminal history, she has little patience for “silly <i>daofei </i>customs” such as nicknames.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now that she has recovered from broken legs in a fight against Yun, Kirima is eager to find less dangerous jobs to set her up for her eventual retirement. Those jobs, of course, need to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be illegal. Now that the Flying Opera Company is more visible to the public eye thanks to its connection to the Avatar, finding jobs is more challenging. Some <i>daofei </i>are hesitant to work with the company, while other <i>daofei </i>are a little too eager because they want something from the Avatar. Anyone looking to join the Flying Opera Company needs to prove their skill and trust- worthiness to Kirima, and she isn’t easy to trick.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lao Ge</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A suspiciously long-lived member of the Flying Opera Company <span class="p">Lao Ge is an old member of the Flying Opera Company who may or may not have the secret to immortality. Rumor has it</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that Lao Ge is over two hundred years old, and he has had many pupils who sought him out specifically to learn his secrets,</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">though Lao Ge refuses to provide any straightforward answers. Also known in some circles as Tieguai, the elderly man uses numerous disguises to avoid drawing attention to himself, such as pretending to be a bumbling drunkard. In truth, he is an Earthbender and a skilled assassin who believes in killing those who cause suffering to others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Those who seek impossible longevity—or training in assas- sination—might come to Lao Ge for help. Finding him isn’t easy, as he slipped into the shadows after Kyoshi defeated Yun. Making a show of bringing down or spectacularly humiliating a corrupt figurehead would likely get Lao Ge’s attention.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wong</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An earthbending teacher dedicated to his <span class="s46">daofei </span>family</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wong is one of Kyoshi’s earthbending teachers and a longtime member of the Flying Opera Company. He is not afraid to put himself in harm’s way in service to his friends and has sought revenge when those friends were hurt or worse. He also has no qualms with stealing from those he feels undeserving, as he and Kirima gladly looted Jianzhu’s mansion and lived off the profits for a time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Earthbenders in trouble with the law and in need of training might seek out Wong as a teacher, and if any member of the Flying Opera Company is in trouble, new or old, Wong is one of the first people to help. Like Kirima, Wong is working on prun- ing and building the company’s criminal network. He hopes to expand it far past Chameleon Bay in the coming years.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mok and Wai</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two infamous criminals with conflicting views of the Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mok is a well-known outlaw and the Yellow Necks’ former second-in-command. He insists on being called Uncle Mok as a sign of respect. He is currently in prison after being arrested by the Ba Sing Se police. His imprisoned associate, Wai, is a <i>daofei </i>lieutenant who highly respects Kyoshi almost to the point of worship. Wai has no trouble resorting to violence as a form of punishment for insubordination, but his reverence for the Avatar trumps his loyalty to the Yellow Necks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Heroes might take advantage of this difference between the two to undermine any nefarious plans they are concocting. Just because Wai reveres the Avatar doesn’t necessarily mean that he respects the wishes of her allies, however. Both men surely</p>

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Auntie Mui</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A knowledge broker and former servant of the Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Auntie Mui is the former head of the kitchen staff at Avatar Man- sion. She has known Kyoshi for many years and she cared for both Kyoshi and the late Yun. Likewise, the Avatar cares for Mui and keeping her safe is important to her. Auntie Mui has a lot of insider knowledge and contacts after working as a servant for so long. She also knows all the ins and outs of the Yokoya Peninsula.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If Auntie Mui overhears a plot against Kyoshi, she may be the one to ask the heroes to protect Kyoshi. Auntie Mui might even make for a good spy at a noble household since nobles often over- look servants.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Beifong Family</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An obscenely wealthy and influential Earth Kingdom family</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Beifong family is a highly influential and wealthy clan with many members. The late Lu Beifong led it until his recent death in the Fire Nation at the hands of Yun. Lu left behind many grand- children but did not have much faith in their potential as leaders or Earthbenders. Still, the family has immense political sway in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Earth Kingdom and getting on their bad side is a huge mistake, while they are a powerful ally to anyone on their good side.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">One or more of Lu’s grandchildren may seek instruction or a special advantage in the struggle to rise to the top of the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">family. Particularly ruthless and ambitious grandchildren may be inspired by the recent Wars of Secrets and Daggers and resort to violence to get ahead. If one of Lu Beifong’s descendants senses a target on their back, they may hire capable heroes to protect them and sniff out assassination plots.</p>

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s47" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Daofei</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Law and Order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the largest threats in the Earth Kingdom during the Kyo- shi Era is <i>daofei</i>—even if the heroes are <i>daofei </i>themselves. These groups of outlaws butt heads with each other and are subject to deadly infighting. Powerful <i>daofei </i>might hold sway over local governments, while weaker groups are much more vulnerable to the authorities. A <i>daofei </i>group might be involved in any criminal activity from smuggling to assassinations, and some, such as the Yellow Necks, even aspire to overthrow the government.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Different groups have different processes that prospective mem- bers need to go through in order to join. While some <i>daofei </i>groups are more informal, many have long-standing traditions centered</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on loyalty and strength that are important to them. Veteran <i>daofei </i>might ask prospective members to commit particularly risky crimes to prove they aren’t cowards, or to perform mundane but grueling tasks for a period of time. Oaths must be sworn upon joining, and should those oaths be broken there are usually dire consequences.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fifth Nation Splinter Fleets</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Betrayal and Loyalty</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the most powerful group of pirates in the world, the Fifth Nation was all but wiped out by Avatar Kyoshi before she was recognized as the Avatar. They kidnapped and enslaved civilians, and became especially emboldened after the death of Avatar Kuruk as there was one less force to keep them in check. The pirate group is composed of people of many different backgrounds and includes benders and non-benders alike. Though reduced to splinter fleets, these pirates have years of experience terrorizing the coasts and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Those who wish to leave their crew be- hind for a new life may make enemies out of former friends depend- ing on that crew’s disposition. No two fleets are exactly alike, as new leaders command them based on their own personal ethics.</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Flying Opera Company</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Flying Opera Company is a <i>daofei </i>network founded by Avatar Kyoshi’s late parents, Jesa and Hark. Once very large with chapters in different lo- cations, it now only consists of the Chameleon Bay chapter. The group comprises the majority of the Avatar’s team of teachers and allies. They historical- ly disguised themselves as traveling performers to hide their criminal activities. Kirima, Lao Ge, Wong, Rangi, and Kyoshi are all members. Those who join generally must make fifty-four oaths, but the most important ones are to never take an honest job and never to abide by the law from that point on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Yellow Necks’ Legacy</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Yellow Necks were a large and infamous group that pillaged settlements and murdered civilians regardless of gender or age. Though they reformed under several different names only to collapse time and time again, some former members still want to return to their former power. After their leader Xu Ping An was imprisoned in Zigan Village, they re- branded themselves as the Autumn Bloom Society. Then, once Xu Ping An was killed, another group reformed as the Triad of the Golden Wing. No mat- ter how many times they are defeated, they always seem to come back under some new name.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Law Enforcement</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Law and Order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The police in Ba Sing Se often make bad decisions in their handling of <i>daofei</i>, and it’s not uncommon for civilians to suffer the consequences. Citizens of the Lower Ring are particularly vulnerable to both <i>daofei </i>and law enforcement as they are not prioritized by the Earth Kingdom government. The police are more likely to go after small <i>daofei </i>groups than bigger ones, because they’re scared and the smaller groups are easier targets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part25.htm#bookmark68" class="s25">A high security prison in the Agrarian Zone of Ba Sing Se beneath Lake Laogai holds criminals of note such as Tagaka (page 42).</a> Escape is nearly impossible, and heroes looking to rescue someone falsely accused must come up with a solid</p>
