<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">This chapter contains all ten of the base playbooks, as well as advice for each playbook’s moves, features, and story arcs. The advice helps expand on the core ideas of each playbook, setting you up for success without demanding you always take the same course, in addition to me- chanics advice on the particular moves and features of these playbooks. Remember that each player in the game should use a different playbook.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Creating a character for <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>always starts by choosing a playbook. You can read more about character creation in <span class="s23">Chapter 4: Making Characters</span>, but this chapter details everything you need to know about the playbooks themselves so you can decide which one is for you!</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ten Base Playbooks</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book features ten playbooks, detailed in full throughout this chapter. Every</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">playbook presented in this chapter includes advice on the core ideas of the playbook, its balance principles, its growth ques- tion, and then its individual features and moves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">The advice about the balance principles and growth ques- tion is there to give you a good starting point for conceiving of the playbook, but as always, those aren’t chains—you should over time explore and elaborate upon your understanding of the character, their principles, and their issues. In the mechan- ical section, not every move is covered—only those which are tricky in some way or require further explanation. The other self-explanatory moves are not detailed further in this chapter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You might notice some differences between your printable playbooks (available in PDF at magpiegames.com/avatarrpg) and the playbooks as printed here—the ones in this chapter are missing all of the blank fill-in spaces and some of the full tracks you’ll find on the printable version. That’s because these are designed primarily for reference instead of actual use; if you’re playing the game, make sure you print out your own playbooks, or use some scrap paper to record additional details. Everything unique about the playbooks, including their special features, moves, and principles, are all included here, though, for you to peruse and examine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This chapter builds heavily on the advice and information from earlier chapters, including explanations of how balance principles work, how moves in general work, and so on. And if you’re inter- ested in knowing more about how your character can grow and change over time, make sure to check <span class="s23">Chapter 7: Advancement</span>.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Building Your Unique Character <span class="p">The playbook you choose is an interesting collection of pos- sibilities and trajectories—like a catapult aimed toward the</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mountains, it’ll generally send you flying toward the peaks, but where you actually land, the path you actually take, is always a bit different. The world of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>holds an infinite number of stories and interesting characters, each one of them unique. Playbooks are designed to get you started, sending you off toward dramatic, involving stories but giving you plenty of room to make your character your own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The two most distinctive and important parts of any playbook to take a look at are the balance principles and the feature. Every playbook has its own unique pair of balance principles that point at the core tension of that playbook, and one of your primary jobs while designing your character is to consider how your hero thinks about their own balance and the ways that the world pushes and pulls them according to the ideals they hold most dear. Every Hammer wrestles with Care and Force…but not every Hammer thinks about Care and Force in the same way!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Every playbook also has its own unique feature that defines whatever is special, both mechanically and in the fiction, about that playbook. Take a close look at each playbook’s feature when choosing which playbook you want to play; they are surprisingly central to the way the playbooks work during play.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ten playbooks presented here are the “base” playbooks because they’re a solid foundation for any campaign of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, but you may have other playbooks available to you (in <span class="s23">Wan Shi Tong’s Adventure Guide </span>or an- other supplement). Those playbooks have their own advice and guidance, found in those respective supplements!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you want to use those additional playbooks, feel free to use them right alongside any of the playbooks featured here. The playbooks are all built to be used together, creating inter- esting tensions and synergies as the companions set out on their adventures. Of course, talk with your group about which playbooks you’re interested in as you make your character; you want to give everyone a chance to talk about what they want to see from the group and the game during your campaign!</p>
