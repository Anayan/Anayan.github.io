<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Kyoshi Era specifically outlines the time directly follow- ing the conclusion of <i>Shadow of Kyoshi</i>. The Four Nations are at peace with one another, but internal political and criminal troubles are rampant. There is governmental instability in both the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom, controversy surrounding the Avatar, and organized groups of outlaws terrorizing citi- zens—this is especially rampant in the Earth Kingdom, where</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">criminals known as <i>daofei </i>seize any opportunity to secure power for themselves. With several individuals in leadership positions either corrupt or unfit to lead, many people have no one to rely on when defending their homes and loved ones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Kyoshi tirelessly works to shape a world safe for every- one to thrive in, but unlike Avatars before her, people question her legitimacy, because her friend Yun was originally declared the Avatar. When Yun discovered he wasn’t the Avatar, he went on a vengeful rampage, driven into madness with the help of a dark spirit. Kyoshi was forced to end his path of violence when they fought and she killed him. Despite the turmoil in her personal life, Kyoshi remains steadfast in her mission to see the Four Nations rise above the conflicts plaguing them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the <span class="s23">Earth Kingdom</span>, the <i>daofei </i>group known as the Yellow Necks tried to make a return under the name The Autumn Bloom Society, but Kyoshi ended their plans when she killed their leader, Xu Ping An. <i>Daofei </i>continue to be a big problem in the kingdom, however, especially in the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. Similarly, Kyoshi may have defeated the Fifth Nation pirate fleet, but a few splinter fleets still roam the waters bordering the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Fire Nation </span>struggles to recover from the Camellia-Peo- ny War—a succession conflict between various clans that threw the country into chaos. Many are unhappy that Fire Lord Zoryu still sits on the throne, preferring his illegitimate half-brother, Chaejin of the Saowon clan, to rule the Fire Nation. Chaejin and his mother, Lady Huazo, live under house arrest with their dreams of claiming the throne shattered. The Fire Lord now looks to create a centralized government, taking any real power away from the clans and placing it behind the throne.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Air Nomads </span>
<a href="part24.htm#bookmark67" class="s25">are isolated in this era and dealing with the loss of important spiritual sites. Many Nomads see the suffering of others outside their temples and wish to help by providing spiri- tual guidance, but often when the Nomads offer help their actions are met with skepticism. Some elders (page 40)</a> now debate</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">this issue internally, but for the most part the Air Nomads remain uninvolved with the human world and focus on spiritual matters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Water Tribes </span>have not suffered explosive drama and conflict the way the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation have. Instead, the Northern Water Tribe sees a strengthening of wealth while the Southern Water Tribe struggles with an economic col- lapse. While some work on the political stage to fight this, many southern tribespeople embrace piracy as a means to provide for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Kyoshi</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kyoshi’s childhood was difficult. Her parents, a runaway Air Nun named Jesa and a thief named Hark, founded the Flying Opera Company, a <i>daofei </i>group. They left Kyoshi in the care of a strang- er in Yokoya Port, and then never returned. Kyoshi was kicked out onto the street and grew up as an orphan.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part21.htm#bookmark65" class="s25">Rather than Kyoshi being identified as the Avatar from an early age, a boy named Yun was mistakenly identified instead. Kyoshi went on to work for Yun and eventually showed herself to be the Avatar when she defeated the Fifth Nation (page </a>34) with a frightening display of earthbending. Kyoshi was eventual- ly forced to kill Yun when spiritual corruption and the revelation of the deceit fed to him as a child drove him to a merciless and violent rampage against anyone who’d ever lied to him about being the Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kyoshi isn’t currently a popular Avatar. Her closest allies are <i>daofei</i>, she sometimes fumbles in diplomatic situations, and she doesn’t hesitate to resort to violence. To those who know her, Kyoshi is smart, decisive, and loyal. She has the makings of a great Avatar, but needs time to come into her own and fix much of what is broken. The people she trusts most in the world are the Flying Opera Company members and especially her girl- friend Rangi, whom she has known since she was a servant.</p>

<p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kyoshi Era Significant Themes</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Justice and Revenge</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">With so many wrongs committed without anyone in power willing to bring the criminals to justice, people may find they need to seek out justice—or revenge—on their own. In many instances, the guilty party <i>is </i>one of the individuals in power. When people cannot avenge or rescue their loved ones them- selves, they look to others to do the job on their behalf, even if those others are outlaws.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Call revenge justice and vice versa</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Put allies on the side of revenge, or enemies on the side of justice</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Force the companions to decide what justice looks like</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Betrayal and Loyalty</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Sometimes the people you trust the most end up hurting you the worst. A student might learn that their bending teacher has kept a terrible secret from them, or a character’s new <i>daofei </i>family might insist upon a show of loyalty that involves harming a former ally. Enemies become teammates, and friends become new enemies. While selfishness is sometimes to blame for these shifting alliances, the desire to survive is often the root problem. That makes true friendships hard to come by in this era, and well worth fighting for.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Test “unbreakable” bonds</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Reveal shocking betrayals</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Turn former enemies into allies and vice versa</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abuse of Authority</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Government and criminal leaders alike abuse their influence over others in this era. While some leaders are incompetent, others are actively cruel and self-serving. Individuals who hold less power are seen as expendable pieces in these crooked big- shots’ games, and those who aren’t careful can become pawns without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Reveal a blatant or hidden abuse of an authority’s power</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Represent a system that defends incompetent leaders</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Manipulate, bribe, or threaten “pawns” into uncomfortable action</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Loss and Abandonment</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Many Earth Kingdom children were orphaned because of the Yellow Neck Uprising; an entire generation of young adults have only themselves to rely on. They were juggled between guard- ians and kicked out into the street, and many were forgotten.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Now these people must learn to trust again. Those who had a very difficult time growing up or were betrayed by someone</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">they trusted may have sworn to never rely on others ever again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Focus on quiet moments of connection and healing</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Lash out against an offer of kindness</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Provide opportunities for people to earn and reciprocate trust</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Law and Order</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Conflicts within and between <i>daofei </i>groups, as well as between criminals and law enforcement, are widespread at this time.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Not all outlaws are the same, and for many having a family of criminals is a better alternative to fending for themselves on the streets. While some <i>daofei</i>, like the Yellow Necks, have lofty goals of overthrowing the Earth Kingdom’s government, other outlaws just want to survive and look out for their own, like the Southern Water Tribe pirates. Meanwhile, local law enforce- ment often doesn’t know how to handle the rampant criminal behavior. In some cases, powerful criminals pay them to look the other way. With many people forced to extremes just to survive, a life of crime is an appealing option.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Provide justifiable reasons for a life of crime</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Display the familial structure of criminal organizations</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Erupt into open conflict between law and order on the street</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s30" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Harmony Without, Turmoil Within</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Appearances are everything to many governments, organizations, and even families. Some groups go through more trouble to appear to have everything under control than they do to actually get things under control. Fire Nation clans who feel their influ- ence wane with the subtle shifts in power might fight to keep up appearances so that their rivals don’t think they’ve grown weak. Air Temples may seem tranquil to guests while Airbenders argue behind closed doors about the direction of their people.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Present superficial positivity masking deeper problems</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Demand conflicts be pushed into the shadows</p>
<p class="s31" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Challenge the status quo</p>

<a name="bookmark65">Important Events</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is a list of important events, which occur leading up to and during this era. Each event has a list of the current consequences for stories in this era.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Wars of Secrets and Daggers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Wars of Secrets and Daggers were collectively a succession conflict between the Earth Kingdom princes in Ba Sing Se that coincided with the Yellow Neck Uprising. Before the conflict, the Earth Kingdom had an extensive Royal Family with each person in line for the throne desiring the title of Earth Monarch. To any- one beyond nobility close to the throne, the Royal Family seem cordial, even friendly, with one another, but as each sibling smiled to one another at court, they sharpened knives behind their backs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">The princes carried out their schemes in secret, hiring assas- sins to do their dirty work while they made a show of being po- lite and supportive of each other at public events. As the princes silently battled, many of the monarchy’s duties were neglected and the common people suffered. The memory of this bloody time is still fresh within Earth Kingdom ministries, and people in power may use an abundance of caution when it comes to personal safety.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Politicians are invested in protecting themselves, not their people.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Many times local law enforcement goes unchecked by their political supervisors.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Earth Kingdom people’s trust in their monarchy is at an all-time low.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Yellow Neck Uprising</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Yellow Necks were a large <i>daofei </i>group based in the Earth Kingdom, named for the yellow scarves they wore around their necks. Their leader, the infamous Xu Ping An, wanted to create a world in which social outcasts ruled, and believed that the spirits supported the Yellow Necks and their revolutionary vision. He ini- tially only had a few followers, but eventually his innate charisma and the allure of unchecked power drew many <i>daofei </i>to his cause.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Xu Ping An was also relentlessly cruel and encouraged pillaging and murdering law-abiders, including children. The Earth King and army were unwilling to protect the more remote villages of the Earth Kingdom, leaving them vulnerable as the Yellow Necks ransacked and destroyed them. The uprising was a startling failure of the Earth Kingdom nobility to protect their people thanks to most of them being embroiled in the Wars of Secrets and Daggers and terror of the Yellow Necks gripped the entire expansive nation. The uprising lasted for years and ended at the Battle of Zhulu Pass about a decade ago when the Earth Kingdom Sage Jianzhu buried many of the <i>daofei </i>alive.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• A generation has lived parentless and fending for themselves.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Many people distrust <i>daofei</i>, even those who claim to help.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Surviving adherents look to re-form the Yellow Necks under different names.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Fall of the Fifth Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Up until recently, the Fifth Nation was the most powerful pirate fleet in the world. Its long history, large numbers, and impressive strength set it apart from other pirate fleets in the world. Members originally came from the Southern Water Tribe, but the fleet was made up of people of all ethnicities and believed in treating their members equally. Because the fleet was so large, splinter fleets broke away to pursue expeditions and other missions on their own while the larger fleet conducted business as usual.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Before it was defeated, the Fifth Nation was led by a woman named Tagaka who inherited the leadership from her father.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tagaka was more aggressive and ruthless than her father and used her tenacity to rebuild the fleet after it was diminished under his command. She did so by attacking other pirate groups and adopting any survivors into the Fifth Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">A couple of years ago, the Fifth Nation met its demise in the South Pole during a confrontation with Kyoshi, the wrongly identified Avatar Yun, and his support team. The Fifth Nation set up the meeting as a peaceful negotiation, but secretly planned</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a trap for the Avatar. Kyoshi destroyed the fleet with intensely powerful earthbending; shortly afterwards, she began training to determine whether she was actually the true Avatar. The Fifth Nation lost their leader, Tagaka, to imprisonment and became little more than a handful of splinter fleets.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Splinter fleets of pirates roam the oceans looking for bounty.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Deprived of a trading partner, the Southern Water Tribe suffers economically from the Fifth Nation’s downfall.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Some pirates seek to free Tagaka and rebuild the nation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The False Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Kuruk, Kyoshi’s predecessor, was a disappointment as an Avatar, and with instability growing worse in the Earth King- dom, there was desperation to find the next one quickly. An</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Air Monk named Kelsang and an Earth Kingdom Sage named Jianzhu visited Yokoya Port in their search for the Avatar. They nearly identified Kyoshi by her interaction with the Avatar relics, but the process was interrupted when she ran away. Instead, an Earthbender named Yun was incorrectly identified as the Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Feeling a bond with the young girl, Kelsang raised Kyoshi at the Avatar mansion where she worked as a servant for Yun. Years later, she used unbelievably powerful earthbending to destroy much of the Fifth Nation while on a mission with Yun and was subsequently identified as the Avatar. However, her abilities were discovered so late, many struggled to believe her status.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When Jianzhu killed Kelsang, Kyoshi made it her mission to avenge her adoptive father, but during her final confrontation with Jianzhu, Yun interrupted, killing Jianzhu himself at the last moment. Kyoshi later killed Yun, seeing no other way to stop his violent rampage against anyone who’d lied to him about being the Avatar.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Kyoshi isn’t yet trusted by the public as the Avatar.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Kyoshi struggles with vengeance and balance.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Avatar mansion was destroyed by Kyoshi and Yun’s final fight.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Poisoning of the Earth Sages</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part17.htm#bookmark58" class="s25">The Earth Sages of the Kyoshi Era were spiritual leaders who wielded a vast amount of political power. The order originated from Bhanti (page 25)</a> immigrants, but through the years the Sages’ purpose warped as they became mired in Earth Kingdom politics. After seeing Kuruk’s failings as Avatar, the Sages were deeply involved in finding his successor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Sage Jianzhu, “Avatar” Yun’s mentor, performed a num- ber of nefarious deeds to cover up his own incompetence once he realized Kyoshi was the Avatar. Amongst them was abandon- ing his own pupil, Yun, to the brutality of the dark spirit who’d revealed the truth (fully detailed in the novel, <i>The Rise of Kyoshi</i>).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When the Earth Sages discovered this treachery, they held a conclave to determine whether Jianzhu should be removed as Yun’s teacher. Having expected this confrontation sooner or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">later, Jianzhu poisoned many of the Sages, greatly reducing their numbers. A supernaturally corrupted Yun later killed Jianzhu while the Sage was battling Kyoshi.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Earth Sages have lost their political power and mistrust one another after Jianzhu’s betrayal.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Some Sages work to return to their spiritual roots away from the corruption of politics.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Local politicians vie for control in the power vacuum left by murdered Sages who were once de facto rulers of certain regions.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Camellia-Peony War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Camellia-Peony War was a brutal succession conflict be- tween Prince Zoryu, who was backed by the Keohso clan, and his brother Chaejin, who was backed by the Saowon clan. Chae- jin was Fire Lord Chaeryu’s illegitimate son, born to his mistress Lady Huazo, and the embarrassed Fire Lord went so far as to forbid anyone in court from mentioning him. When Chaeryu died, Zoryu claimed the throne and the two clans looked for any excuse to clash. One such excuse came when Kyoshi inadver- tently set off a diplomatic crisis by misidentifying Chaejin as Zoryu, and then speaking out of turn to Zoryu himself, at the Royal Palace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Both sides in the war were ruthless and more than willing to resort to lies, manipulation, and violence. Fire Lord Zoryu won and wanted to destroy the entire Saowon clan in his victory, but Kyoshi prevented him from doing so. He has since made it his mission to weaken the Fire Nation’s noble clans so that eventual- ly all Fire Nation subjects will be loyal only to the Fire Lord.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Fire Lord has promoted family members of loyal clans within his government and ousted any rivals.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Clans in general become less significant; common people unhappy with their current clan’s ruler begin to look to the Fire Lord to resolve the situation, instead of keeping it an internal clan matter.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• The Saowon clan is a dying clan with little to no political capital.</p>
