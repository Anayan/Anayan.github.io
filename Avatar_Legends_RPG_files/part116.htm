<a name="bookmark320">maybe Lei is offering a lot of money to find her daughter in spite of Ziming’s assurances. There are numerous reasons the players could want to help, but they should decide on one that best justi- fies their buy-in for their characters to participate in the adventure.</a>
<a name="bookmark260">&zwnj;</a>
</p>
<p class="s23" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve established why the PCs agree to help<span class="p">, it’s up to them to decide how to investigate; although, they’ll find themselves tangled up in this clash of factions no matter what happens through your use of escalations.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are a few ways the PCs can aid in the investigation beyond any plan they may engineer themselves. If they seem stuck on what to do, offer them the following information from an NPC or via gossip they’ve heard on the street. Then use your player-facing moves, GM moves, and escalations to take the adventure from there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Reported thefts have increased in the Middle Ring since the carnival arrived, and Detective Ziming is suspicious, especially since the carnival was where Rose was last spotted. Ziming suggests the PCs go undercover and join the circus. Only as one of the carnival’s own can</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the PCs discover what really goes on backstage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The infamous Paper Lantern Gang runs the territory in the Middle Ring where the Flying Koi set up their carnival. If Rose was kidnapped on their turf, they’re either involved or they have information. Ziming thinks they might be willing to share a lead—or return Rose—in exchange for</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">a favor or enough money to make it worth their time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part118.htm#bookmark324" class="s25">• Lei’s seen Rose hanging out with a “rough-looking” woman; even though her daughter has hidden the relationship well…a mother just knows. Lei had her housekeeper follow the woman and discovered she frequents the Stone Kettle (page 276).</a> Fearing she’d push her rebellious daughter further away, Lei did nothing, but now Rose is missing… could the mystery woman have something to do with it?</p>
<p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through the course of this adventure, use an <span class="s11">escalation </span>if the conflicts start to falter, the pace of the story slows, or the players are unsure of what to do. Each escalation reveals new information about the situation and forces the PCs into action. If players are invested in Rose’s kidnapping but unsure how to proceed, escala- tions toss clues or key characters into their path. If the players are not invested in Rose’s kidnapping, escalations give them opportu- nities to become involved or, if PCs stay hands-off, to demonstrate how their inaction does or does not affect the city around them. You can read more about crafting your own escalations on page</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part104.htm#bookmark307" class="s25">261.</a> Here are some examples of escalations you can use:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Cabbages tumble through the streets, chased by a frantic Cabbage Merchant. A witness to the kidnapping, the Cabbage Merchant can be a helpful clue-giver</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for stuck investigators if they show him kindness and help him gather the spilled vegetables.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A violent clash over territory erupts in the streets between the Paper Lanterns and Flying Koi Carnival. If no one stops them, the fight eventually ends but not before causing injuries to innocent bystanders and irreparable damage to surrounding property. During the chaos, a ransom note is slipped into Lei’s pocket, implicating</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the winning faction and demanding money…or else.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• As her case comes to a close, Detective Ziming identifies a culprit—either Ringmaster Peng or Gang Leader Cong, depending on the PCs’ location—and leads</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a raid on the Flying Koi Carnival or Paper Lantern headquarters. If no one intervenes, the leader is apprehended and led away while loudly declaring they have new information to prove their innocence.</p>
