<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Four Nations Summit &amp; Technological Symposium <span class="p">in Hari Bulkan is about to start, with representatives from all Four Nations gathered in the Fire Nation capital. The summit is set to last an entire week, and during that time delegates will each pres- ent different technological advancements from their nations. On the opening night of the summit, Khuchtei, trailed by Captain Enaka of the Fire Nation guard, bursts into the meeting hall</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and announces that someone has stolen multiple crates of rare meteorite metal from the Fire Nation. She doesn’t halt the con- ference—all eyes are on the Fire Nation, and she wants it to be a success—but she’s ordered patrols of guards to roam the halls, and she demands that the crates be returned immediately.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Taqukaq was sent by Avatar Roku to ensure everything went smoothly at the summit. Both the Avatar and the waterbending master foresaw a possible political incident occurring at the sum- mit and it is important that the delegates keep the peace with one another so the summit doesn’t turn into an international incident. The Waterbender doesn’t want to out himself as Roku’s spy, and Taqukaq knows the heroes from an event established in the “Introduction”, so he tasks them with helping him find the crates before it is too late.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">There are three possible suspects:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Sumati: </b>An Air Nomad aiding a spirit attached to the meteorite metal</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Pohu: </b>Taqukaq’s jealous rival from the Southern Water Tribe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Ikru: </b>An inventor with a secondary mission to spy for the Earth Kingdom</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To ensure the investigation is fresh and exciting, the person who hid the crates and their motive aren’t predetermined. Each of the suspects has a possible motive. As the players work their way through the adventure, you’re free to decide which suspect</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should be the thief, whether it be the suspect the players are sure is the culprit, the one they’re closing in on, or even the one that they trusted!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once Taqukaq entrusts the players with their task (see “Intro- duction”), they can investigate and they will definitely discover secrets: all of the delegates are hiding something. Although the players can choose how they want to investigate the delegates, they must do it stealthily. If they approach the delegates aggres- sively, the PCs might get arrested by the Fire Nation guards, cause an international incident, or worse!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Complicating matters, the spirit <b>Rust </b>(see “Special Circum- stance: Rust”) was attracted to the crates by the delicious smell of meteorite metal and then to the summit as curiosity got the best of them. Rust, troubled by aggressive actions, starts the path towards becoming a Dark Spirit. Depending on the course the adventure takes, Rust could be the true issue the heroes must deal with.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Finally, after sneaking around, questioning delegates, and put- ting out political fires, the heroes eventually determine who stole the meteorite metal. They have plenty of options for dealing with the thief, the crates, the spirit, and how to finish up your adventure is detailed in “How it Ends.”</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Meteorite Metal Crates</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meteorite metal is used to create unbreakable weapons, and this property, plus its scarcity, makes it more valuable than gold.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The crates comprise the largest cache of meteorite metal in the entire world. Khuchtei planned to unveil samples from the cache at the summit as a point of pride. Her plan was to use the metal to build various new machines for the Fire Nation, maybe even</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a tank, which she’s heard the Fire Lord has been particularly interested in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The crates currently sit in a supposedly-empty compartment in the summit storehouse. At the start of the adventure, only the thief knows of their presence there. Although it’s obvious that someone put the crates there, as GM you don’t have to decide who that is right away. In fact, you may want to wait until the he- roes have a few suspects they’re paying more attention to before deciding who’s really at fault.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">
<a name="bookmark338">Suspects</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Below, multiple characters are suggested as the culprit who has hidden the crates, and while not everyone can be the real culprit, you can use the motivations to cast doubt on (or point to) a suspect throughout your game.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Sumati</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomad’s motive for stealing the crates is actually altruis- tic. She was drawn to a spiritual presence in the Fire Nation cap- ital city, ultimately discovering the crates where they were being stored, near Khuchtei’s workshops. Inside the crates, she discov- ered Rust, the spirit drawn to the meteorite metal. Unbeknownst to the leader of the Air Nomad delegation, Ugyen, Sumati snuck out in the days leading up to the conference, meeting with the spirit to find a way to appease them. Since Rust has tied themself to the metal, Sumati is worried what will happen to the spirit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if the metal is destroyed or forged. All this sneaking makes her particularly suspicious to anyone paying attention. If she is the real thief, then she stole the crates at the start of the convention to keep Rust safe and try to keep the spirit away from the other delegates, although she has no idea what to do with the metal now. If the characters learn she’s behind the theft, she’s likely to ask them directly for help.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Sumati is the thief...</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">...she’s stashed the crates in the sewers, hoping to keep them safely out of the way where no one would think to look.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Pohu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An ambitious man, Pohu has a simple motive: he wants the meteorite metal to improve his career. Meteorite metal is precious because it is believed to be unbreakable once forged. This feature is enough to get the technologist excited at the prospect of working with the material. Pohu is also an academic rival of Taqukaq and is often overlooked for important projects in favor of his northern counterpart. If Pohu is the true thief, then he sees the theft as a way to completely surpass his rival in their field and to take Taqukaq’s place on any new projects. Pohu wouldn’t have stolen the metal directly; he would’ve used a set of loyal Southern Water Tribe guards (who normally stay on his ship) to transfer the metal secretly in the night.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Pohu is the thief...</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">...he’s taken the crates back to his ship and hidden them in the hull.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ikru</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ikru certainly has the means to commit the theft; as the head delegate for the Earth Kingdom, Ikru has the resources and pow- er to arrange for the crates to be smoothly and quietly moved out of Khuchtei’s workshops. But Ikru’s motive is a bit more mixed. If he’s responsible, he stole the crates to bring them back to the Earth King and earn the prestige of designing something using this small fortune. He also suspects the Fire Nation is up to no good with the ore, on the basis that he’s always mistrusted his Fire Nation colleagues. Ikru’s heard rumors that the Fire Lord has been interested in war machine prototypes, and nothing good can come from Sozin having a large cache of metal that’s</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unbreakable when forged. So, stealing the metal helps both to keep his nation safe and to boost Ikru’s prestige. Ikru is a capable agent as well as a technologist, and he would’ve used some of his secret gadgetry to steal the metal straight out from under Khuchtei’s nose, bit by bit over several nights.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If Ikru is the thief...</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">...he’s hidden the crates in a secret tunnel he’s bent below the summit with earthbending.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Parties of Interest</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While there are officially only Four Nations, five delegations are attending the summit, with each of the two major Water Tribes having their own diplomatic parties. There are 50 people at the summit, including among them Captain Enaka, guards, and many other delegates. If the players want to talk to other people, you should feel free to give one or two of these people names and per- sonalities. However, try to refocus the game on the main suspects in order to keep the action manageable. The following characters are people from “Important Characters &amp; Groups” with real stakes in the theft, who can help you re-center your story:</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Taqukaq<span class="p">—As the one who alerted the heroes, Taqukaq isn’t a suspect for the PCs. However, that doesn’t mean that he isn’t involved in secret plots. The Water Tribes sent him to the summit with a secret mission—to learn if the Fire Nation has stolen Water Tribe ship designs. Because of this assignment,</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taqukaq spends significant time poking around where he’s not allowed to be. Although his skills and prestige have kept him out of trouble so far, the heroes could learn that he’s more than what he appears and have a reason to confront him.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Khuchtei<span class="p">—The crates were stolen from right under Khuchtei’s nose and she wants them back. She’s aware that meteorite metal is believed to be unbreakable once forged, and she wants it to further the Fire Nation’s technological progress. If she could figure out a way to forge a large amount of the metal at once, she could use it on the new overland war machine proto- types Fire Lord Sozin commissioned. These tank-like machines would be the pride of the Fire Nation fleet and earn Khuchtei endless bragging rights among her peers. The theft of the mete- orite metal is tantamount to an act of war in her mind, and until the theft is resolved, she grows more and more unstable and prepared to take extreme action.</span>
</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hong<span class="p">—Hong appears to be a high-ranking Fire Nation guard</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in charge of security at the summit, but he secretly is a spy from another nation. Rather than assigning Hong a possible motive, consider him a fluid NPC that you can use to amp up the espi- onage feel of the Roku Era. You could use Hong as a rival to the person who stole the crates or as a spy working with the person who stole them. Use Hong to cast doubt on who the true culprit is or as a guide for the PCs when they’re in a tight spot—al- though Hong won’t hesitate to betray the PCs to steal the metal for his own employers. Hong is also a capable opponent, and thus a good choice as the true thief. If he is the thief, make sure to tie him to some employer, including far-off powers and rulers.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Special Circumstance: Rust</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rust is a tiny spirit who appears as a shimmering, translucent elderly humanoid, albeit only a foot tall. Their name comes from the fact that their skin and clothes both appear to be made out of orange rust flakes. Rust was drawn to the physical world after the Fire Nation piled a huge amount of meteorite metal together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They’ve been orbiting around the metal, appearing and disap- pearing at will, following wherever it goes. <b>Once Rust arrived at the summit, they were curious about what was happening and decided to observe</b>—it’s been a long time since they’ve been to the physical world, and they are largely disappointed by the scheming and greed they’ve seen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the summit progresses, the spirit takes on the negative energy of the attendants. Everyone is distrustful of one another, angry, and on the brink of fighting; this throws the spirit out</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of balance. <b>Each time someone takes a violent or massively aggressive action </b>against another person, Rust’s balance track is shifted toward their Chaos principle by one and they double in size. If this shifts Rust’s balance off the end of their track—if they shift toward Chaos four times—Rust becomes a dangerous Dark Spirit and rampages the summit. They cannot be fought</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">using traditional combat exchanges—attempts to do so end with the PCs getting tossed away easily. Instead, they must be brought back onto their balance track in order to control themself again.</p>

<span class="s21">Chaos</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rust’s balance may only shift back in certain ways—normal moves won’t shift Rust’s balance, and players cannot <b>call out Rust’s principles</b>. Rust’s balance will only shift when PCs:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Foster cooperation among rivals or foes (getting the delegates to work together)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Show Rust that humans are capable of kindness (convincing someone to give aid with no gain in return)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Show Rust humans acting in mercy (forgiving wrongdoing like the original theft)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Other acts of heroics, self-sacrifice, or nobility of spirit</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are a few ways the heroes can help Rust before they become a Dark Spirit<span class="p">, such as defusing tensions between dele- gates, or even telling them of the spirit’s existence. Of course, the PCs need to know that Rust exists before that can happen. The PCs can accomplish this by successfully questioning Sumati, even if she isn’t the thief—in that case, she discovered Rust and the metal before someone else stole it. She can find Rust as the spirit wanders the city, but she can no longer find the metal itself, so following Sumati at night leads the PCs to the spirit.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part135.htm#bookmark343" class="s25">Likewise, if you’re using the pregenerated characters (page 110),</a> they’re all Air Nomads and could be sensitive to spirits in the area, especially Chegu, who might sense a spirit in the area from the start of the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Or, if the tensions go on long enough, Rust’s presence be- comes obvious as the spirit grows larger (and more dangerous). Once the heroes know Rust exists, the PCs can try to ask them for help or information. Rust knows who the meteorite metal thief is, but they’re not sure if they can trust the companions until they prove themselves.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">How It Ends</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The amount of in-fiction time it takes to discover the stolen metal and solve the crisis is entirely down to the dramatic pacing of the adventure. The summit is scheduled to last a full week, meaning that you can use changes in time liberally, advancing through the day and moving on to the next. On the other hand, it’s entirely possible that the heroes deal with the theft in a single day, either by connecting the dots and visiting the right loca- tions, or because you are setting a faster-paced, more intense game. Generally speaking, allowing more time to pass between scenes provides a more contemplative feel, while going hard from scene to scene with immediate follow-up gives a much more urgent feel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">The full week of the summit does give the PCs time to rea- sonably investigate each of the NPCs, keep track of the dele- gates’ comings and goings, search their rooms, and rifle through their storage areas. Because the delegates are generally at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zoryu Hall during the day and at Tako Dormitory at night (see “Important Locations”), the PCs may wish to pass some time to make sure that it’s the right time of day to find people. Don’t emphasize using up every single minute of every single day in perfect efficiency; PCs still need to eat and sleep, too! If time is passing, however, make sure to allow PCs to periodically clear 1- or 2-fatigue as they rest. They might even clear conditions as time passes from day to day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Taqukaq sets the heroes a very specific task: find out who stole the crates and why. Assuming the PCs follow the task set out for them, when they discover the thief—be it on the first day or at the end of the week—they will likely wind up in a confron- tation with the thief. How the heroes decide to handle that con- frontation is completely up to them—and if that confrontation turns violent, it can trigger Rust’s fall toward Chaos!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Make sure not to neglect Rust when bringing the whole adventure to a close. While there are plenty of dangers related to the theft itself and the way it can break down international relations, Rust is in many ways the most immediate threat in the entire adventure. As the spirit moves closer and closer to Chaos, they become more and more of a genuine threat to everyone at the summit, without ever having actually done anything wrong. The final confrontation with the thief can easily transition into a final conflict about how to deal with Rust, as the spirit becomes a Dark Spirit and goes on a rampage. After all, Rust’s balance advances toward Chaos every time anyone takes a violent or massively aggressive action against another person, and con- fronting the thief will almost certainly turn in that direction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Try to think of this adventure like an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. The adventure could end with <i>the heroes helping Sumati smuggle the ore (and Rust) out of Hari Bulkan to a little island where Rust can come and go in peace; </i>or the adventure could end with <i>the PCs confronting Ikru for stealing the ore, just as Khuchtei comes in with guards to arrest him and the delegates…leading to a giant fight the heroes must defuse! </i>Regardless, the end of the adventure should give the players a chance to feel special—and to feel that their actions make a real difference as they pull off a victory against the odds.</p>
