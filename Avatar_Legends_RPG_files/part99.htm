<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next chapter, <span class="s23">Chapter 10: Running Adventures</span>, contains information on creating individual <span class="s23">adventures</span>—self-contained sets of conflicts that amount to an episode of your campaign— and a sample adventure set in the Aang Era. If an adventure is like a single episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, a <span class="s23">campaign </span>is more like an ongoing series of episodes, a set of adventures that individually resolve while leaving room for a larger story to emerge over time. In one adventure, the compan- ions might defeat a minor villain and save a village…but over the larger campaign the companions have to reckon with the forces that put that village in danger in the first place.</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Starting Campaigns</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
	<a href="part99.htm#bookmark241" class="s25">Preparing an adventure usually involves sitting down before each session and thinking through the key elements; starting a cam- paign, on the other hand, means thinking about how you want to focus your story, present the game to your players, and portray antagonists across many sessions! Running a campaign is more involved than running a single, isolated adventure—often called a one-shot (page </a>249)—but it can be a deeply rewarding experi- ence. Subtle shifts in the PCs’ balance tracks build up over time into shifting centers and dramatic decisions; ongoing adventures give players opportunities to use their Moments of Balance and advance their characters; and recurring antagonists may even allow the companions to convince a long-time foe to switch sides!</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Some campaigns only last a few short sessions—perhaps two</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
		<a href="part51.htm#bookmark120" class="s25">to four episodes—and center primarily on the group focus the players chose at the start of play (page 110).</a> However, some campaigns last longer, the episodes coming together into a <span class="s23">sea- son </span>that has its own finale and resolution. Running any length of campaign requires you to think carefully about how you set up and start your story, but longer campaigns also require you to structure and manage the fiction between sessions, hoping to emerge over time with a cohesive whole.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This chapter covers these challenges, both giving you prac- tical tips on what you need to start a successful campaign and helping you understand how to create characters, conflicts, and exciting conclusions that make longer seasons feel worthy of the Avatarverse.</p>
		<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Your First Session</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The players have a fairly clear, focused job for the first session: they choose their playbooks and fill them out, selecting their moves and techniques and filling out their features. As the GM, you have a tougher job—to create a believable slice of the Avatarverse that <span class="s23">ensures the world feels real</span>, while filling that slice of the world with conflicts that <span class="s23">make the PCs’ stories</span>
	</p>
	<p class="s23" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">meaningful and important<span class="p">, and also </span>playing to find out what happens<span class="p">. It might feel like more work than tracking down an otter-penguin in the snowiest tundra!</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">But have no fear—while the players set up their characters, you’re setting up everything you need to start playing without plan- ning anything. In fact, setting up the game gives you everything you need for a single session of play or even a whole campaign!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">You do most of your work setting up the game together with your group, but you need to take care of a few things before you sit down (or get on an online call) with your players.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Materials and Prep</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing in person, print out all the playbooks you want to offer to the players, and make sure you have a broad idea of their balance tracks, moves, and features. You don’t have to offer every playbook—maybe you don’t want to deal with the Successor’s family or the Pillar’s squad in your story—but take the time to un- derstand the ones you make available. Also print out enough basic moves sheets for yourself and every other player. You might want to provide everyone at the table a copy of the <i>Campaign Creation Worksheet</i>, but at minimum you should have one, and you should print yourself a copy of the <i>GM Sheet</i>. Gather up some index cards or other scrap paper, and provide enough pencils and dice for everyone to have their own set while you play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing online, make sure all of your players have ac- cess to all the materials and let them know which playbooks they should consider. You also want to make sure you’ve got every- one on the same page with whatever video or audio call system you’re using and however you plan on rolling dice!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You also want to take the time to read most of this book! You can probably skim <span class="s23">Chapter 6: Playbooks </span>and <span class="s23">Chapter 7: Ad- vancement</span>. You definitely need to read <span class="s23">Chapter 3: Fundamen- tals of Play </span>and <span class="s23">Chapter 8: Running the Game </span>carefully; both sections contain what you need to know to run the game well.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Selecting an Era and Setting Tone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part51.htm#bookmark118" class="s25">It’s usually a good idea to select an era (page 108)</a> and scope with your players before you start playing. You can decide to choose an era when you get together, but everyone benefits from having some background for the choices you make when you start.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You might even suggest an era to your group that you feel comfortable with as a GM. <span class="s23">Chapter 2: The World of Avatar </span>provides everything you need to know about each era—includ- ing significant themes for each—but it’s totally okay to say you want to focus on an era or two that you’re most familiar with, or that you think best fits the kind of game you want to run. For example, you may prefer the Hundred Year War Era because it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">feels most like the original run of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>and that’s the show you know the best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Whatever era your group picks, review the era section in <span class="s23">Chap- ter 2: The World of Avatar </span>and note the significant themes and adventure hooks—that’s why it’s useful to choose in advance of the first session, so you have time to look over the setting. When you review your chosen era in this book, take some notes on what you think is most interesting so you can talk about it during your first session! Discuss with your group the major themes you want to feature, and collectively agree about what kind of tone you want the game to have. Is it a light-hearted romp in the Kyoshi Era, filled with lawless adventure? Or is it a serious exploration of the challenges of governance set after <i>The Legend of Korra</i>? Any era can hit multiple tones, so make sure everyone is on the same page about what your campaign will feel like!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
	<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Starting the First Session</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone is ready to play—but before anyone makes a character—start by completing the <i>Campaign Creation Work- sheet</i>
	<a href="part51.htm#bookmark119" class="s25">: select the scope and a group focus and detail the inciting incident. You can read more about choosing the group’s scope and focus on page 109,</a> but your primary job as GM is to facili- tate the group’s discussion.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can still participate in the discussion, and in some cases, you might even come to the table with a pre-selected scope and focus—this is your game, too, and you should be excited to play in that world. But most importantly, the players must be invested and interested in the answers they give, so they can make excit- ing characters and portray them to the hilt!</p>
	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Making Characters</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the group has decided on the focus and inciting incident, it’s time to make characters. Introduce each playbook and give a brief overview of each, focusing on the main issues and tensions that type of character brings to the game. Answer any questions that come up, and make suggestions to players struggling to pick a playbook. Make it clear that choosing a playbook is much more about the character’s arc in the story than any particular ability, training, or technique!</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remind your players to pay close attention to each feature and their balance track; both playbook elements are a huge part of the experience of playing <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Generally, each playbook is keyed to one or two stats, starting with higher values in those stats than any others, so also point</p>
	<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changing History</p>
	<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Depending on which era you chose for your game, it’s possible that the PCs’ actions might alter the history of the setting. For example, a group of he- roes in Roku’s Era might stop Fire Lord Sozin from building up his military to attack the Air Nomads by alerting Avatar Roku to Sozin’s true motives. How could he wipe out the Air Nomads without suffi- cient forces?</p>
	<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">It’s best to decide before you start playing how your group wants to handle events that disrupt the ca- nonical history of the Avatarverse. For some, the of- ficial history might be a mere guide, an idea of what might happen, easily disrupted by brave adventurers. Others might view the events featured in <b>Chapter 2: The World of Avatar </b>as unalterable; either changes <i>cannot </i>happen if they alter history or some other event must change the setting back off-screen.</p>
	<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There’s no right answer to how to play the game! Just make sure that everyone at your table knows how your group is dealing with the established history before you start play!</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
		<br/>
	</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">those out when applicable—“The Successor is a high <span class="s52">Creativity </span>and <span class="s52">Focus </span>playbook, so they spend a lot of time looking for advantages (or even <span class="s11">tricking </span>people) and are pretty competent when they <span class="s11">rely on their skills and training</span>. Does that sound fun?”</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone has had time to make their characters, go ahead and have each player introduce their PC. Some folks might need a bit more time, but they can catch up as everyone else introduces their characters!</p>
	<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Asking Probing Questions</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the players are introducing their characters, ask them probing questions to expand on what they say. Try to alternate between asking questions about the information they’ve already given you—“Why did your mother give you her most cher- ished sword?”—and asking new questions that ties them to the scope and focus of the story. Everyone should already have an answer to “Why do you care about this group or purpose?” but dig deeper, asking questions like “How did you meet the other PCs?” or “When did you first learn that [foe] was a threat?”</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The goal of these questions is to both help players think about their characters and to give you lots of material to use in future conflicts. If the Prodigy’s mother gave him a cherished sword because she was so proud of her son’s skills, you can bring that character into play—either directly when she appears in the story or through NPCs who reflect her view of the Prodigy. Probing questions give you tools for invoking the emotions and conflicts the players want to see their characters engage, and all you have to do to figure out what they want to see in the story is ask them!</p>

	<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">You don’t have to prepare an entire adventure before you start playing, but you want to have a good conflict in mind as well as a few NPCs. You can read more about preparing adventures in <b>Chapter 10: Running Adventures</b>, but remember that you’re <i>playing to find out what happens</i>! It’s okay to discover some of the adventure, including the major antago- nists and details of the conflict, alongside the PCs.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
		<br/>
	</p>
	<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">During the First Session</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Character creation usually eats up a fair amount of time in the first session—sometimes even as much as two hours—but even when it takes a while to get through introductions (and all your questions!), you usually have time to start the companions off with a new episode.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your goals for the first session are simple:</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Set up a conflict that draws in the companions</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Show off the Avatarverse and these new heroes</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Go through the mechanics of the game</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Create an awesome episode of your campaign</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once everyone has finished creating their characters, take a break and prepare an opening conflict to draw the PCs into the story. You might use an existing adventure that fits your group, but for a campaign, it’s often a better idea for your first episode to draw upon whatever conflict the players decided on as their group focus. For example, if they’ve chosen to “defeat a danger- ous foe,” then you may start them off with a conflict and story that gives them a chance to advance that goal.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If possible, you also want your first session to hit the follow- ing mechanics:</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Every basic move, including <span class="s11">help a companion</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Balance shifts, <span class="s11">living up to a principle</span>, and</p>
<p class="s11" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resisting shifting your balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Conditions, taking them and removing them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Combat, including the <span class="s11">stance move </span>and statuses</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to showcasing the mechanics, you might want to try the following during that first session as well:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Ask questions constantly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Bring the action</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Build on character creation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Call out moves as they happen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Invoke the era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Offer moves when players flinch</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Shift their balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Test their training</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ask questions constantly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Never stop asking for more details throughout the whole first session. Any time a question occurs to you about the fiction, ask it. “What happens to the bandits when you bring them back to the city?” “Why did you decide this outpost was the right one to attack?” “Who trained you to use your swords to scale stone walls?” Every answer gives you something new to build upon, a new idea you can bring into play right away…or something you can save for later, as you think about the rest of your campaign.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bring the action</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rather than spend a lot of time setting up and hoping the players get to the conflict, throw the companions into the middle of an interesting situation. Perhaps they are sneaking into the villain’s headquarters or attacking a particular holding the villain uses often; start off in the middle of the action and figure out the plan as you go! <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is about cool heroes taking action to make the world a better place <i>right now</i>, not after they’ve held an hour-long planning session about how they are undertaking some action and adventure.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Build on character creation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The more you reincorporate elements the players introduced during character creation, the better. Try to include several NPCs or factions the players mentioned when introducing their char- acters, and take every opportunity—even when the companions are on the run or in strange situations—to tie the first session to everything the players have told you about their characters. After all, it’s far better for the companions to face an NPC antagonist they established in their introduction than for you to invent a brand-new character to whom they have no attachment.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Call out moves as they happen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Look for opportunities to show off the basic moves; any time a player triggers one, call it out to them, asking, “It sounds like you’re trying to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>, right?” At the start of play, players need a bit of help recognizing when they’ve triggered a move or which move they’ve triggered. Don’t force them into a particular action—they</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">can always say “No, that’s not quite what I want to do…”—but mod- el for them what it looks like to move from actions in the fiction to the mechanics of the game and then back to the fiction. If players try to trigger moves without fiction, help them out there too: “I’d love to see you <span class="s11">intimidate </span>this guard! What does that look like?”</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Invoke the era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No matter how you set up the initial situation, make sure that you get to the heart of the conflicts you and your players have decided to focus on. Every era has many conflicts it can repre- sent, but you discussed with your group the tone and emphasis for your game—so bring that out during play! For example, the GM for a group that decides to emphasize political intrigue in the Roku Era might reveal that someone close to the compan- ions has betrayed them to advance a political goal; a group that decides to focus on post-war recovery in the Aang Era might encounter tensions boiling to the surface that threaten a fragile peace. Nothing is simple in the Avatarverse; complicate the situ- ation in a way that makes the PCs think hard about their values!</p>

<a name="bookmark241">Offer moves when players flinch</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, don’t tell players what to do—leave their actions up to them. But in this first session, offer suggestions about moves they might make, especially when they seem hesitant. Always phrase it as a question rooted in the fiction—“You’re a Waterbender, right? Do you want to <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>to slide down from the top of the building on a stream of ice? Or maybe you want to <span class="s11">intimidate </span>these thugs with a show of force?” Often players go for a third option of their own creation, but your little push can get them thinking about what they really want to do.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Shift their balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From the very start of play, have NPCs try to shift the bal- ance of the companions. Have the villains tell them who they are—“You’re just a weapon, aren’t you? Trained to hurt those</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">who disagree with you…”—and have their allies remind them of the consequences of their actions—“I can’t believe you stood up for me. I’ve never seen such loyalty.” <span class="s11">Call them out </span>as well, less frequently than mere shifts in their balance, but regularly enough to remind them that they can <span class="s11">call an NPC out </span>as well.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Test their training</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, always give the PCs a chance to show off their awesome abilities, both by presenting challenges that their trainings can solve—“The bridge is out! How do you get across?”—and by confronting them with antagonists itching for a fight. The <span class="s11">stance move </span>and statuses do most of the work of managing the fight for you, but take some time to push the players to explain how their fighting style shows up every time they fight. An Earthbender who creates rock walls and large obstacles creates different statuses, different effects in the fiction, and inflicts different con- ditions than a combatant who armors themselves in stone and charges into the fight!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">After the First Session</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve finished the first session, start to think about where things might go from here. You’ve probably got a good idea of who the PCs are and what they care about, and you’ve already started to develop a roster of NPCs to bring into the story to keep it moving. And don’t forget the consequences of whatever the players did in the first session! Often, whatever happens in the first session becomes a critical part of the narra- tive moving forward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Let all these elements percolate; you can use them to build out a whole season of stories for your group—not by planning the full plot of each story, but by using everything your group built in the first session as hooks for the adventures and episodes that happen next!</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-Shots</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Maybe your group is just trying out the system or you’re running a special session of the game at a convention for people who can’t get together a second time. In those and similar cases, rather than create a whole campaign, you might decide to only run a single session of <span class="s59">Avatar Legends: The Roleplay- ing Game</span>. In addition to preparing an adventure, here are a few tips for making a one-shot of the game awesome:</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TIE EVERYTHING TOGETHER</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Look for every opportunity to tie things together, both during the game and in character creation. Is the Hammer’s adversary the same character who caused the Idealist’s tragedy? Is the Successor’s family the reason the Pillar’s squad temporarily dis- banded? You’ve only one chance to make the play- ers care about the fictional world you’re creating together, so do everything you can to link up their stories—and the consequences of their actions— into one cohesive whole. It’s a lot more satisfying for two characters to address their stories together than for one of them to have all the spotlight.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MAKE THE STORY CINEMATIC</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">
<a href="part93.htm#bookmark227" class="s28">Think of your session less like the pilot episode of a new show and more like an Avatarverse feature film. Make harder moves (page </a>229) and bring the consequences to a head early and often. You don’t</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">have time to wait for a plot to develop or for a rela- tionship to blossom; bring the heat right away so the PCs can actually resolve the big issues at play! Shoot for resolving the group’s focus—escorting an NPC, defeating a villain, etc.—by the end of the session!</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">START WITH THE ACTION</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Above all else, start your players in the middle of the action, narratively and mechanically. Frame scenes in which the companions are already in a heap of trou- ble—in which their plans have gone awry but there’s still a chance they can save the day—or put NPCs they care about in harm’s way. Don’t be subtle with your moves or your NPC’s plots! Think like Varrick— his movers always open with action so exciting the public can’t help but watch!</p>
