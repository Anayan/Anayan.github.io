<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a finale, your group needs to decide what happens next: is that the end of the companions’ story or merely one chapter in a longer campaign? If it’s the former, take some time to debrief the sessions and learn together what worked and what didn’t; if your group decides to continue, here are some tips for moving into the next season.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The More Things Change…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, identify everything that needs to change, in particular fo- cusing on the PCs and their commitment to the group through its scope and focus. In order for a new season to start, something significant must change in the story—if all the PCs kept the same playbooks, the scope and focus remained the same, and no new characters joined the story, then the season really isn’t over! Something big has to shift in the story for you to begin a new season, and that starts with understanding how the PCs relate to the existing scope and focus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In many ways, this reflection might cause your PCs to reevaluate what the group’s focus really was over the course of the last season. They might have started out trying to “change the culture of Hari Bulkan,” but perhaps their real focus became “defeat a particular antagonist” or “gain some new training” that now helps them in their larger goal. In turn, that means the focus or scope for the new season might remain “the same”—but only because it turns out the prior focus or scope was different than everyone thought! As the focus of the new season is clarified— and the scope of the story becomes more refined or shifts to a new location—make sure the players understand those changes and how they affect the companions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">It’s fine if all this reflection leads to a PC ending their com-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mitment to the group! That just means their story has taken them elsewhere, and it’s time for a new character. After all, Toph wasn’t in <i>“Book 1: Water” </i>of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>! Any player whose character isn’t returning should choose a new playbook, and as a group, at the end of any other changes, go through the inciting incident again with a new incident for the new group and its focus and scope.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In addition to new characters, some existing characters might want to change playbooks. Follow everything in <span class="s23">Chapter 7: Advancement </span>for those characters and talk about the ways in which the audience can tell that the character has changed forev- er. Perhaps a Successor who turned against his family to become the Hammer changes his clothing to reflect this new allegiance; perhaps an Idealist who gave up on Forgiveness to become the Adamant doesn’t change her look…but anyone who knows her can tell something is different.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Finally, make sure that you take the time to establish some nar- rative gap between the last season and the new one. Sometimes that gap is rooted in time—a few months or even a few years—but often it’s about grounding the new season in something different, like a new location or a new set of conflicts. A new setting almost always means a new scope and vice versa, so make sure to take that into account. Talk openly with your players about how the next season might be different and work together to establish what has changed.</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Spin-Offs and Generational Play</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Your group might also decide to do something more adventurous, like make all new characters for the entire group or jump forward in time and play the next generation of heroes. Whatever tale you all decide to tell, use the events and characters from your existing story as a backdrop for the process</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">of choosing a scope, focus, and inciting incident. Your new characters deserve a fresh start for their very own stories, even if the world has been built by those who came before them!</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">…The More They Stay the Same</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That said, everything else should stay the same! Players can keep their techniques, their current center—although they probably should clear all fatigue and reset their balance to center—their moves, and their growth. Unless something has to change for the new season to make sense, that feature should stay the same and continue the arc the characters followed for the previous season; resetting the center of balance, for example, robs players of the ability to choose a path for their characters over multiple seasons.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part100.htm#bookmark243" class="s25">Likewise, it’s a great idea for you to involve NPCs and con- flicts in the new season that weren’t resolved in the last season. You may need to generate some new season threats (page </a>252) as you get started, but usually a lot of your work as a GM can continue as your story continues. The main reason groups want to keep going is to see more of the characters and stories your group established. Don’t feel like you have to throw out every- thing and start anew!</p>
