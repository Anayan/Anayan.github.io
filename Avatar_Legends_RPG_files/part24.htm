</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads have isolated themselves while struggling with mounting internal issues. Leading into this era, Earth Kingdom Sages blamed the Air Nomads’ detachment for Kuruk’s failures as an Avatar. This tension continued when the Air Nomads of the Southern Air Temple provided sanctuary to Kyoshi after her con- frontation with Jianzhu. Many opposed the idea that she was the true Avatar, but the Air Nomads still took her in. This has culmi- nated in the Air Nomad Elders focusing their people on internal matters, not only to avoid conflict, but as a matter of survival.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Thriving towns near Air Nomad temples struggle with ban- ditry, causing the townsfolk to leave to larger cities in search of work and safety. Having been burned one too many times by in- terfering with others’ lives, many Nomads are hesitant to get too involved unless asked for direct assistance. Rather than working with the towns to build a sustainable life near the temples, the Air Nomads accept that each individual has free will and must do what they need to thrive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This detachment is compounded by the loss of spiritual sites, which Air Nomads have protected for years. Avatar Kuruk’s mission to destroy Dark Spirits left many spiritual sites in the hu- man world unattended. While the Air Nomads struggled to pick up the slack, their mission fails and comes to an end in this era. Thanks to human meddling and lack of care, the final few spirits residing at these sites will pull their homes into the Spirit World, further separating humans and spirits. Air Nomads accept that reversing what’s happening is a lost cause, and now focus on protecting the sites while they still remain and recording what knowledge they can before it is lost to humans forever.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Four Councils of Elders</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An esteemed council of Air Nomads who serve as leaders</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each Air Temple is governed by a separate council of elders. Members of the elder councils are master Airbenders, having earned their tattoos and more before serving their people. These elders serve as leaders in both political and religious capacities, and help to identify the Avatar during eras when the Avatar is born into the Air Nomads. The Council of Elders at the South- ern Air Temple took Kyoshi in during the tumultuous time right after her reveal of her Avatar status. The Elders can be set in their ways, however, as the Southern Air Temple Elders exiled Kel- sang and marked him in a lower place of honor in their registers because he had taken lives. Airbenders seeking spiritual guid- ance may want to ask their local Council of Elders for advice, or the Elders may send an Airbender out into the world to pursue some mission if they truly believe it serves the greater good.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Namthöse</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An Air Nomad elder set on keeping Airbenders out of the world’s troubles</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Namthöse is an esteemed member of the Northern Air Temple’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Council of Elders. He is an avid proponent for the Air Nomads staying uninvolved in the conflicts of the world and actively tries to discourage young Airbenders from absorbing too much outside news for fear they will become distracted from their paths. Currently, he is trying to instate a rule to allow only Air Nomads to visit the Northern Air Temple while also preventing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Airbenders still in training there from interacting with outsiders. He believes that the other three nations are so prone to violence that they must not be permitted to influence young Airbenders in any way. Foreigners who have business with the Northern Air Temple find it very hard to get in touch with anyone other than those Namthöse deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jinpa</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An air monk, secretary to the Avatar, and secret member of the White Lotus</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">A monk from the Southern Air Temple, Jinpa is Kyoshi’s secre-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tary and a member of the White Lotus. Jinpa excels at handling the intricacies of political and diplomatic matters and tries to keep Kyoshi in check when she gets carried away with dealing with the corrupt through violence. Though he chooses pacifism when he can, he understands that sometimes a fight is necessary for the greater good. He is secretly involved with the Order of the White Lotus and takes his responsibilities as a member seri- ously, doing his best to help Kyoshi become a great Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">During this era, the Order of the White Lotus’s activities and very existence are hidden from the public. Jinpa may occasion- ally drop hints to Kyoshi about his involvement, but he never admits to anything outright. Those who heard rumors about the secret order and want to do good in the world may find the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">group very attractive, but discovering any information about it is a challenge all on its own. Jinpa isn’t likely to reveal the existence of the Order, but could be swayed if the Avatar’s life is at stake.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Matangi</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The head of an Earth Kingdom orphanage outside the Eastern Air Temple</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Matangi, a renegade Air Nun, is the head of an orphanage in the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Earth Kingdom, despite advice from the elders to stay out of world- ly affairs. She originally founded the orphanage to help children orphaned in the Yellow Neck Uprising, where the crisis led to a large number of deaths. Many of those children are grown-ups or teenagers now, and sometimes they come back to her for help when they run into trouble. Whenever one of her former charges turns out to be in a <i>daofei </i>group, she is torn between staying uninvolved and helping them. Much of the time, she can’t bring herself to turn her back on those who need her no matter what the circumstances.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Matangi has a way of fostering greatness. Heroes who need to find someone who grew up in the orphanage may seek her out, but she only gives information if she trusts them not to hurt her former charges. Many of the children she helped raise would do anything for her, so she has quite a network of contacts to pull from when disaster strikes as well.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s Lost</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">What is the Singing Path? Who is Róng? What other spiritual sites are the Air Nomads losing? These specifics are up to you and your game. None of the sites the Air Nomads protect in this era make it to the Roku Era and the Nomads know they’re fighting a losing battle. Stories you tell surrounding these sites engage the theme of Loss and Abandonment from the unique perspective of the Air Nomads. A player who chooses to portray an Air Nomad in this era must balance their spiritual duty and their nat- ural inclination to travel and explore. The tragedy of the Air Nomads in this era is that while they are accused of not caring about the outside world, they in fact care very deeply. So deeply that they often must ignore worldly concerns to focus on preserv- ing spiritual knowledge for generations to come.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Much of which, we as fans of the Avatarverse know, is sadly lost during the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyemtsen</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Air Nun fighting her secret desire to exact revenge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gyemtsen is an Air Nun from the Eastern Air Temple. She left her position as a sought-after airbending teacher to protect the Singing Path after her sister died protecting it. The Singing Path is a spiritual site in the Earth Kingdom guarded by a spirit named</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Róng and is now corrupted by a <i>daofei </i>group known as the Ghost Tigers using it as a hideout. Thanks to continued harassment by the Ghost Tigers, Róng now wishes to pull her home into the Spirit World, but can’t do it while they’re still there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Ever since her sister’s death at the hands of the Ghost Tigers, Gyemtsen struggles with urges to exact vengeance, urges that vi- olate the ethics of the Air Nomads. She chases the Ghost Tigers through the winding stones of the Singing Path and steers them away from neighboring towns…while inching ever closer to the idea that if she can’t find a way to remove them from the Singing Path peacefully, she will do it by force.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mangal</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A restless soul in tune with the spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mangal is a troublemaker (at least by Air Nomad standards) who lives in the Northern Air Temple. He has snuck away from the Northern Air Temple many times before and used to play tricks on the Air Monks as a kid. Though few know it, Mangal is very good at spirit projecting and communicating with spirits. He can even solve problems in nearby villages just by sensing what is causing the spirits distress and helping to fix it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Mangal is contemplating running away from the temple for good since he’s so misunderstood. He knows the surrounding area well, including places where local <i>daofei </i>frequent. Heroes with spirit problems or issues with local <i>daofei </i>would find a useful guide in Mangal, but he does have a tendency to get into trouble.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protecting the Avatar Relics</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Law and Order</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the Air Nomads’ responsibilities is to protect the relics used to help identify the Avatar. These relics are a collection of four toys (a stuffed hog-monkey, a clay turtle-duck, a drum, and a whirligig) that belonged to past incarnations of the Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When testing children to see if they are potentially the Avatar, the relics get mixed with a wide variety of random toys. The Air Nomads display the toys in front of the children, and if one of them chooses the correct ones, it indicates that the child has memories of their past lives as the Avatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Very early in this era, the toys were stolen by an air monk named Kelsang to expedite the search for the Avatar, highlighting the relics’ vulnerability. Though Kelsang returned the relics when he was finished with them, the Air Monks worry about them be- ing stolen again by outsiders or traitors. Other parties may want to steal the relics for nefarious reasons, which would be a devastating loss for the Air Nomads. For instance, a wealthy antiquarian might hire a thief to steal a relic for his collection, or an Air Nomad who wants to create a new sect might take them as leverage.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exile</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Loss and Abandonment</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads on the whole value pacifism and emotional detachment, so when one of their own engages in violence or reckless behavior there are consequences. Kelsang, Kyoshi’s late adoptive father and an Air Monk, was exiled from the Southern Air Temple after he destroyed a Fifth Nation splinter fleet and stole the Avatar relics. Airbenders who follow his example are likely to find themselves in exile as well, and it is not easy to get back in the Air Nomads’ good graces.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Air Nomads who turn from their people’s teachings and face exile may band together and explore the world. Perhaps, they do not denounce violence when it is used to defend innocent peo- ple. Many elders condemn this selfishness, claiming that it only serves to divide the Air Nomads and ignores the spiritual duties each Nomad has. This embrace of freedom is growing, however, and there is little the Elders can do to stop it.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Criticism of Philosophy</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Harmony Without, Turmoil Within</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the Air Nomads highly value peace, pacifism, and detach- ment, they often do not get involved with conflicts taking place outside their bubble. That said, many Air Nomads involve them- selves in spiritual matters no matter what nation they are in. This can lead to people in the region they visit resenting the Nomads for their focus on their own personal goals and the spirits, rather than the people standing right in front of them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Air Nomads are likely to face these types of criticisms when traveling throughout the world, or they may feel similarly about their people’s philosophy themselves. When arriving in a new area, Air Nomads may be refused entrance even if they’re there to solve a matter with spirits. Likewise, Nomad infighting on whether they should help people outside their nation could hinder a group’s mission, despite everyone’s best intentions.</p>
