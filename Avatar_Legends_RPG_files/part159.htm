<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The PCs’ goal in this adventure is very clear—rescue Varrick! But as they uncover more and more about the situation, they will reveal elements that complicate their aims. They also have to stop the bombing, and at the end of the day, they have to contend with a foe who is both very powerful and a tiny bit justified in his anger. Exactly how the PCs deal with all these problems, and how they even go about discovering the truth, is open-ended with several routes to success. They might pursue</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">any of a number of different directions, any of which can provide the answers they need.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The heroes can deal with the situation in any way they choose. They may decide to storm the Dumpling HQ, fireballs flying, demanding answers, or they might try to ingratiate themselves to the Terra Triad to learn more. No matter what they decide, the action shouldn’t stop. Use escalations to add conflict when the players run out of ideas, if the action falters, or to reveal new information and add action to a scene. These escalations can work alongside those of the clock—these allow tensions to ramp up within a scene, while the clock’s escalations build tension across multiple scenes. Some escalations will provide new infor- mation, which may make the players question their actions, and other escalations can purely be an opportunity for action. Here are some examples:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• San Ho, flanked by a large gang of mercenaries, corners the PCs. He offers the PCs money and favors to back off. If that won’t work, he’ll explain aspects of the situation, not</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">revealing that he’s Yinuo but describing the terrible things he believes Varrick did. He’ll ask why they feel it’s so important to protect such a bad man and whether they value justice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the end, if the PCs still refuse him and haven’t otherwise tricked or handled San Ho, he’ll have the goons attack and capture them—and if the PCs are captured, he’ll put them into the water treatment facility right next to Varrick!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Lin Li, proprietress of Everything but the Dragon!, speaks a bit too loudly about San Ho and how he’s squeezing Dragon Flats. The PCs find Terra Triad members trashing her shop, with Wei Tia outside, not participating and looking ashamed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The PCs cause too much commotion and a squad of metalbending police are sent after them—treat the police as a single Master group NPC (see the core book on page</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">236). The police will pursue the PCs until they’re caught and imprisoned, and won’t listen to the PCs’ mad explanations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Kiaanii attacks Warehouse 26 after piecing together enough of what’s happening, causing lots of trouble and getting herself captured. San Ho accelerates his plans to match</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the situation—tick one more segment on the clock!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Wei Tia inadvertently indicates his reluctance to keep doing San Ho’s dirty work—next time the PCs see him, he’s in the midst of an ambush by Steely Ning and the Terra Triad members who are loyal to San Ho!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Detective Story</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is an episode of clues and detection, of investigation and tact. This should be a fun interweaving of areas throughout Republic City, with choices made by the PCs potentially having significant consequences to the stability of the city.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Don’t try to hide the truth from the players! Nothing’s less satis- fying in a mystery story than an unsolvable mystery. What’s more, <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is about action and adventure. The mystery of this episode is great fun, but it’s important the PCs get to <i>act </i>on the information they learn, trying to solve the problems that the mystery underlines. Rely upon the core truths that the PCs must learn by the end of the adventure to make sure they’re getting enough information to act with confidence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The clock for this adventure is another important tool to ensure that the PCs don’t have forever to solve things. Make sure to describe time passing—the time of day is changing—and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to create a sense of urgency. At some point, the PCs will likely choose to act boldly, without knowing the full answers, because time is passing—that’s great! Let them try to shake loose more information through action!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The core premise of the adventure also has the PCs acting clandestinely on behalf of President Moon. Once the PCs discover evidence of a crime and conspiracy, they might be tempted to go to the police or other authorities, but that’s anoth- er way the clock comes in—there’s no time! They don’t have a direct line to Chief Lin Beifong at all, so they’ll be waiting for a while to see some skeptical cop who doesn’t even know Varrick has been kidnapped, and who might even be in San Ho’s pocket! They can’t easily find the ever-busy Zhu Li Moon, and even if they do, they’ll have to get through Sho Lin first—and Sho Lin doesn’t have much trust in them! All of these maneuvers eat up valuable time, time the PCs don’t have.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As for acting quietly and staying under the radar, the more the PCs advertise that they are working on behalf of Zhu Li Moon to find Varrick, the more trouble they are liable to cause, not just for Zhu Li but for themselves as well. The Terra Triads will take notice and might send even more goons to try to stop the PCs. San Ho might escalate the plan, effectively advancing the clock. And the whole thing might get out in a way that’s em- barrassing for Zhu Li, causing drama for an ongoing campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Make sure that all the NPCs of the adventure act on the information they are given. When Kiaanii is told about Varrick’s disappearance, she might start looking into it herself—and might wind up in a chair right next to him! If Wakkanai under- stands what’s going on, she might choose to directly confront Commissioner Chao right in City Hall! Move the NPCs around so they can take dramatic action, preferably directly in front of the PCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In particular, Wei Tia is an important NPC to portray in a sympathetic light. He starts off as an opponent, and the PCs might very well fight him head-on, but ultimately, he doesn’t have any interest in supporting San Ho’s plan to completion. If Wei Tia is too antagonistic, the PCs won’t believe him at all—so make sure to convey elements of his reluctance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">And if the PCs try to split up to cover more ground, point out to them that triggering the move for picking up leads definitively requires the group. If they split up, they don’t have enough eyes on the ground to thoroughly search the places they go!</p>
