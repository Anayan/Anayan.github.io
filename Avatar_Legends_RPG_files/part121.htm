<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se is in chaos after a <i>daofei </i>outlaw kidnaps the two children of Fire Nation Ambassador Quin. The Ambassador has called in her own highly-skilled Fire Nation guards to find her children because she is mistrustful of the Earth Kingdom anti-corruption task force called in to do the job. And the Ambassador is right to be suspicious! The task force is using this event as an excuse to finally round up all the criminals they want, regardless of whether they had anything to do with the kidnapping, and a new <i>daofei </i>mercenary group is using this dis- traction to wreak havoc in the Lower Ring…it’s a mess, and famed Firebender Rangi knows that without intervention Ba Sing Se is in trouble. She tasks the heroes with ensuring the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se stays stable until she can return with the Avatar.</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using This Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The contents of this adventure create a sandbox for your PCs, a setting in which they can choose any path they’d like to move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the story forward. Here are some of the tools you can find here:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Summary” provides an outline of the adventure and explains the various issues plaguing the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Introduction” brings the PCs into the story and sets up your group to undertake the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Characters &amp; Groups” provides the backstories of NPCs, including the various groups working in the Lower Ring, and their stats for use in your game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Locations” features different areas for the PCs to explore during the adventure and explains where important characters might be found.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “GM Advice” contains additional guidance for this adventure just for the GM, including advice on how the adventure might end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Pregenerated Characters” is a set of five premade characters your players can use to hop right into the adventure. We also include a hook that ties the characters to the adventure.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">No Path to the End?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are used to running adventures with heavily detailed encounters and prepared NPCs, it might come as a surprise that few mechanics are written into this adventure, beyond the esca- lations and some information about various characters. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>relies on players triggering moves based on the actions they take during play instead of asking players to make any specific checks for specific actions required by the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since every significant action a PC takes drives the action of the game forward, <b>there is no prescribed order of events</b>. Instead, the adventure puts the PCs in a dramatic starting situ-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ation that demands immediate action from the heroes! It’s your job to use the material in this adventure to keep things moving, providing interesting events and NPCs to consistently engage your players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about running <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game </span>in the core book, <b>Chapter 8: Running the Game</b>, and more about how moves shape play in <b>Chapter 3: Funda- mentals of Play</b>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s10">Using the Pregenerated Characters </span>There are five pregenerated characters at the end of this adven- ture. Each character has a unique history, playbook, and set of stats. Your players can either use these characters to play through this adventure, or they can create their own as explained in the <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The pregenerated characters have their moves, feature ele- ments, and techniques already chosen; players need only decide whether to shift their balance by one step at the start of play, and which principle to shift it toward. Players can adjust the pregen- erated characters to make themselves more comfortable, altering names, look, and even mechanical elements like the stat boosted by the free +1 at character creation if they are familiar enough to make that choice. The characters are designed to work well with the current elements included and the adventure as presented, but as always, if the GM and player agree then they can make changes as desired. After selecting the pregenerated characters, players will still go through the process of filling out connections with each other.</p>
