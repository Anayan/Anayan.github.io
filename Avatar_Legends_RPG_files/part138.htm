</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The premise of this adventure sets the players up for a fun chase through the Earth Kingdom with various factions on their tails. They’ve been tasked by Long Feng to <b>reach a garri- son outpost of Earth Kingdom soldiers outside of Ba Sing Se with the war plans</b>; everything else surrounding the deeper issues of this adventure, like what to do with Onomu, is left up to the players to decide.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Onomu was a prominent Fire Nation general in the Earth Kingdom, and her defection has become something of a legend in the colonies. Onomu was called to a war council with the Fire Lord, and during the meeting, her ego got the better of her. After a few terse words with the leader of the Fire Nation, her life was in danger. The only thing Onomu could do was flee, and on her way out, she stole Fire Nation war plans as leverage for asylum from Long Feng—if she makes it to Ba Sing Se. This is an issue for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Onomu is conspicuous in the Earth Kingdom </b>thanks to her former rank and position. The players must</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">make sure she remains hidden, or it could cause real trouble for her escape. The meat of the action will come from the players sneaking through towns and dodging either the Armadillo-Bears or the Rough Rhinos.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Onomu is an embarrassment </b>to Ozai because she eluded the Fire Lord’s grasp and escaped the Fire Nation proper. Ozai wants her dealt with quickly and quietly. The Rough Rhinos were recruited because they are brutally effective and loyal to him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Long Feng doesn’t actually want Onomu to survive</b>; he just wants the plans. There is no war in Ba Sing Se, after all, and while Long Feng needs to know what the Fire Nation is up to, he doesn’t want a notorious Fire Nation general in the city.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This adventure confronts the players with decisions about a few issues and moral quandaries. Onomu is in the early days of her defection, and so far, she seems mostly to have defected for survival—can she truly be redeemed for her crimes? Everyone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">wants Onomu dead—can the heroes get her to safety, and where is truly safe? If they get the plans to Long Feng, he will give them something they want—how much will they sacrifice to get it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This summary explains the adventure’s conflict under the assumption that the PCs want to bring the war plans to Ba Sing Se. Troubleshooting for companions who don’t want to do that is given in the “GM Advice” section.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The Path to Follow</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This adventure includes five locations, which together make up the smartest route for the companions to travel from the Earth Kingdom coast (where this adventure begins) to the outpost of Ba Sing Se (where this adventure ends).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The heroes know this is the quickest, safest route, and they’ve taken the time to plan out where to go, even if they’re chased.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There’s no need for the players to agonize about where to go next<span class="p">; the PCs are competent, and they make the best choice based on the information they have on hand.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each location has its own set of obstacles that the heroes must overcome, may choose to get involved with, or might ignore to focus on their goal of getting the plans to the Earth Kingdom. In addition, <b>each location has a suggested escala- tion </b>(see “Important Locations”) that you could use in lieu of one of the general escalations in “GM Advice”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The locations are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>West Heiatu</b>—a Fire Nation colony in the Earth Kingdom that the PCs have previously visited. During their stay in the town, they can choose to help the owner of the local teahouse get out of some trouble with Fire Nation guards.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>So Bai Oasis</b>—a remote oasis of peaceful tranquility, which has yet to be affected by the war. This tranquility could be disturbed by an escalation when the Rough Rhinos attack!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Xiadi</b>—an underground rebel city where the heroes must decide whether to plead for passage or sneak through with a known Fire Nation defector.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Laoshan</b>—a destitute town next to a rich mine the Fire Nation exploits for ore. During their stay, the players can decide to liberate the forced laborers within the mine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Ba Sing Se Outpost</b>—the location to which the PCs are initially asked to bring the war plans. They can meet with Yanran, an agent of Long Feng, who demands the war plans and refuses to let Onomu into the city.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To make things easier, have your PCs <b>experience each location in the order they’re presented in “Important Locations” </b>so long as it makes sense for what they’ve done in the story so far. In theory, you could craft an entire session out of every location in the adventure, but the war plans are not safe until they are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part142.htm#bookmark351" class="s25">in Ba Sing Se, and the antagonists should feel relentless in their pursuit. The Hundred Year War is a dangerous time to be aiding a Fire Nation defector in the Earth Kingdom, and threats are coming from every direction. Advice on how to deal with the re- al-world time your adventure takes can be found on page 131.</a>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mode of Transportation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are many miles between the coast and Ba Sing Se, with cities large and small that the PCs could visit. The focus of this adventure is, for the most part, on interacting with interesting locations and getting the war plans to Ba Sing Se and not on traveling between locations. The path is lengthy and fraught with danger, but <b>the heroes have already found the quickest, safest route</b>. They need to stop at different locations out of necessity— to rest and restock.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Much of the traveling in this adventure is likely on foot, and you can take a few moments to talk about this with the players, but it isn’t the focus of the adventure. Ask each how they feel about the long journey and what they do to pass the time. This conver- sation is also a fun moment to spotlight a PC’s special feature or animal companion if they have it. Here are some examples:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If you have an Icon among your PCs—and they chose the <span class="s11">Yip! Yip! </span>move—travel might be easy! They’ll have an animal companion large enough to ride.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If you have a Successor among your PCs, they may have the “cold hard cash” or “high technology” granted by their Lineage Resources. If they do, they could easily secure a boat, carriage, or something even fancier as a mode of transportation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Antagonists</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A few antagonists, both hidden and overt, are on the players’ trail throughout the adventure; each has their own motivations for wanting the war plans or Onomu.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng<span class="p">—The Grand Secretariat wants two things that are nonnegotiable: the first is to acquire the war plans and the second is for Onomu to never enter Ba Sing Se. He’s made a deal with her in bad faith and has no intention of holding up his end, hoping she’ll perish along the way. The “Introduction” establish- es the characters as useful allies to Long Feng, but his nefarious nature likely won’t be exposed in this adventure—leading to later intrigue for the players in Ba Sing Se and future stories.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of the players’ interactions with him are through his agent Yanran, and though Long Feng might not feature in the adven- ture itself, his influence is felt throughout.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Take note that Long Feng is on the “right” side of the war against the Fire Nation. He will use the plans to aid the Earth Kingdom and protect the people in Ba Sing Se, but he cares very little for a former Fire Nation general who had a change of heart when her life was at stake. If the players can think of a solution for Onomu that doesn’t involve her entering Ba Sing Se, Long Feng will likely accept it.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Yanran<span class="p">—Yanran is a powerful Earthbender and agent of Long Feng who portrays himself as an incompetent mid-level minister. He has aspirations of one day taking over Long Feng’s role but knows he has many more steps before he accomplishes that goal. He meets the heroes at the final outpost of Ba Sing Se and asks for the war plans. Yanran’s games are guile and sub- terfuge, and he does everything in his power to get the plans without revealing his true capabilities…however, if push comes to shove, he’ll do anything required to complete his mission.</span>
</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Ben Ta and the Armadillo-Bears<span class="p">—The Armadillo-Bears are a group of Earth Kingdom rebels who normally focus their efforts on defending destitute towns from the Fire Nation. They were pulled into this conflict when their leader, Ben Ta, got word that Onomu was spotted nearby. </span>Ben Ta has a person-</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">al vendetta against Onomu. <span class="p">She led the Fire Nation forces that took over Ben Ta’s rural home, and soon after, Ben Ta’s elderly mother died. The rebel leader directly links her death to Onomu’s soldiers seizing food and medical supplies for the war</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">effort—supplies that could’ve helped her mother. Ben Ta means well but is totally unbalanced when it comes to the Fire Nation, and she sees the world in black and white. It might be possible to convince her to hold off on killing Onomu, if it were for the good of the Earth Kingdom, but that certainly isn’t an easy road to travel—she’d need some clear proof and evidence to come around to that idea.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There’s a high chance of convincing the Armadillo-Bears, outside of Ben Ta, to stop hunting Onomu…or maybe even convincing them to help if the conditions were right. These are people fighting to defend the Earth Kingdom, and they could be convinced to put aside their vendetta for a time. One way to accomplish this is to appeal to Ben Ta’s second-in-com- mand, <b>Rameh</b>. Rameh loves his leader—they grew up as best</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">friends—and still believes she can move past her hatred. Rameh doesn’t truly know if Ben Ta’s mother’s death could’ve been prevented, but he still sees most Fire Nation citizens as greedy oppressors who need to be stopped. His is the voice of reason</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the Armadillo-Bears, and he will probably be the one the PCs can reason with.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Rough Rhinos<span class="p">—Onomu’s defection is a massive embarrass- ment for the Fire Lord. Word is already spreading of her open defiance, and before it spreads further, Ozai wants her caught.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Lord’s advisors hired <b>Colonel Mongke </b>and his merce- nary band, the Rough Rhinos, to find Onomu, “deal” with her, and get the war plans, and they’re committed to that task. The Rough Rhinos are perfect for the job because they’re loyal to the Fire Nation and ruthlessly effective, which hopefully means that exposure of Onomu’s betrayal will be minimized. Violent,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cruel, and loyal, the Rhinos have hunted a number of people and razed villages through the years, and most people are too afraid of them to ask many questions. The Rhinos are unwaveringly committed to their job, and the only thing likely to stop them is a deadly threat to their lives…or the illusion of one.</p>

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Onomu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Onomu is a hard woman to read at first, tough, and even rude in her manners. She’s in the early days of her defection and only ran away because she was afraid for her life. That said, there is a lot the disgraced general hadn’t considered while in her former role. Traveling through the Earth Kingdom and interacting with its citizens on a personal level could be the first steps to her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">turning over a new leaf…or she could stay as rotten as she was at the height of her glory. And this is all dependent on whether the heroes want to do something about her or not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At the start of the adventure, Onomu treats the PCs as little more than servants, and they’ll need to earn her respect (if they want it) by showing how competent and balanced they are.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Displays of strength and kindness are necessary to penetrate her hard exterior. She needs to understand on some fundamental level that not everyone is like her, scheming and out for them- selves. Some people just want to help because it is the right thing to do. If the companions manage to demonstrate real heroism and selflessness by the end of the adventure, they will have taken the first step to reforming the jaded general.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the scope of this adventure, it’s important to note that <b>Onomu will not relinquish the plans willingly until her sur- vival is assured</b>, even if she trusts the PCs. She isn’t stupid, and she knows that these plans are probably the only thing keeping her alive and protected. If the players manage to show Onomu that there is some good (and hope) left in the world, she may consider parting with the plans, if the PCs can come up with an alternative solution that keeps her alive.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">How It Ends</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This adventure likely ends at the Ba Sing Se Outpost with the players speaking to Yanran, who demands the war plans from them. He also makes it clear that there is no way Onomu will be allowed into Ba Sing Se. He’ll ask nicely at first, providing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">compliments, offering bribes, but in the end he’s on a mission he intends to complete. The heroes can handle Yanran any number of ways, and there is no right way to end the adventure. Here are some examples:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If the PCs decide to defend Onomu and let her keep the plans, they are now truly “enemies of the state” or, more specifically, of the Grand Secretariat of Ba Sing Se and his enforcers, the Dai Li. What they do from here is up to them, but Ba Sing Se will now hold greater dangers than they ever expected; if they try to enter</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the city, they can expect enormous difficulties.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If the PCs get the plans for Long Feng, those plans will genuinely help the Earth Kingdom’s battle with the Fire Nation. The PCs are welcomed in Ba Sing Se as honored guests and given quarters in the city’s Upper Ring. After a while, they’ll be visited by Long Feng (with a Dai Li guard), who’ll entertain the PCs and answer their questions, before likely sending them out of the city on another errand—by no means would Long Feng want to keep such competent, self- determined, and—most importantly—uncontrolled figures inside the city he tightly controls. The next errand won’t be mindless or useless, however; Long Feng intends to use these capable figures to help win the war and protect Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">• If the PCs help Onomu see a different way of being, likely</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by helping her to overcome her own principle of Survival, then they will likely have an ally. Even if they do turn over the plans to Long Feng and leave Onomu out in the cold, she will have a different perspective on matters, likely seeking a new life of redemption, helping the people that she harmed in her prior days with the Fire Nation. If the PCs help her change her mind and also protect her from Long Feng, then they will have an ally more than happy to give them whatever aid—and training—she can in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If the PCs betray Onomu, likely by taking the plans from her against her will for the greater good of the Earth Kingdom, they have made a true enemy and destroyed any chance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that Onomu would become a better person. Onomu is still on the outs with the Fire Nation, but she is resourceful enough to find new ways to protect herself and build power against the PCs, even if it means starting from the bottom.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Try to think of this adventure like an episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. The adventure could end with <i>the heroes valiantly defending Onomu against Yanran and Dai Li agents</i>; or the adventure could end with <i>Onomu slinking off into the darkness, betraying her agreement in fear for her life</i>. Regardless, the end of the adventure should give the players a chance to feel special—and to feel that their actions make a real difference as they pull off a victory against the odds.</p>
