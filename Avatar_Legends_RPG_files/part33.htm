<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Hundred Year War Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Kuei, the 52<span class="s48">nd </span>Earth King, currently rules the Earth King- dom from the heart of Ba Sing Se under the corrupt guidance of Grand Secretariat Long Feng. Kuei is completely unaware that a war is even happening as Long Feng has taken extreme</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">measures to keep him in the dark. Kuei may be king in name, but the Grand Secretariat makes all decisions for him. He has even forbidden Earth Kingdom citizens from so much as mentioning the war to maintain the ruse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark82" class="s25">With the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se repaired after Iroh’s siege (page 58),</a> it is as ready to defend against Fire Nation attacks as ever before. Likewise, the mountaintop city of Omashu flourishes as a bastion of resistance against the Fire Nation. Its</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">technologists and crafters supply the bulk of weapons to the rest of the Earth Kingdom resistance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite Omashu’s best efforts, the rest of the Earth Kingdom struggles. The Fire Army has conquered or destroyed many areas, and the Earth Kingdom cannot defend all its territories. Refugees from throughout the kingdom flee to Ba Sing Se in hopes of finding safety there and as a result, the Lower Ring is overcrowded. The quality of life is subpar in this part of the city, and many issues there are ignored by the government.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sadly, being ignored by the government in Ba Sing Se is often the best fate an Earth Kingdom citizen could hope for. Rural government officials and Fire Nation soldiers take advantage of the chaos to harass and extort locals. Some Earth Kingdom sol- diers stationed in small villages steal from their own civilians and threaten anyone who stands up to them. Even within Ba Sing Se, the Dai Li—a secret police force controlled by Long Feng—in- timidates and brainwashes anyone who speaks of the war. Ba Sing Se’s walls may keep civilians safe from the outside, but very little keeps them safe from corrupt forces on the inside.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A scheming politician who controls the crown</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng, the corrupt Grand Secretariat of Ba Sing Se, keeps the Earth King in the dark about the existence of the Hundred Year War. His thirst for power makes him ambitious, and his skill as a manipulator combined with the king’s sheltered life makes it easy for Long Feng to use him as a puppet to further his agenda. In addition to serving as advisor to the king, Long Feng is also the head of the Dai Li. He keeps secret files on people of interest locked away in his office and sometimes intercepts letters to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or from them. While the Dai Li handle most minor incidents (catching someone speaking about the war), people who consis- tently get the Dai Li’s attention or are caught sending a message to the king must face Long Feng directly.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King Bumi</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The feisty king of Omashu and master Earthbender</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bumi is the eccentric, elderly king of Omashu. He’s highly skilled at earthbending and though he appears frail, scat-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ter-brained, and whacky with his wry smile and unkempt hair, he is in fact stronger than ever. Under his guidance, Omashu turned from a remote bastion to the main supplier of weapons for the Earth Kingdom resistance. Bumi fosters his most skilled inventors to create practical and effective weaponry and uses his tactical mind to get these supplies all over the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Even with Bumi’s best efforts, the Fire Nation is taking land faster than he can supply it. If a hero can help the King smuggle weapons or foil Fire Nation plans, he’d happily accept their help. He might even teach someone advanced earthbending tech- niques if they truly help the war effort…although that requires them to decipher his lessons through the whispers to himself and the giggling outbursts.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Council of Five</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Five generals who report to a corrupt official</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Council of Five is a group of five Earth Kingdom generals who lead the Earth Kingdom war efforts. Led by General How, the council oversees all things militaristic and also presides over the Royal Earthbender Guards. In addition to How, the other members are the wrathful General Sung, the taciturn General Yiwen, the strict General Khièu, and General Duanmu, who is just about fed up with Long Feng’s machinations. Each of them lives within the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se and they frequently convene at the palace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Historically, this group worked in conjunction with the Earth King as his hand-picked advisors, but during this time they are appointed by Grand Secretariat Long Feng. The Council of Five share all of their plans and information with Long Feng because they believe it is in the best interests of the Earth Kingdom. How- ever, some council members may be willing to keep small secrets from Long Feng if convinced it serves Kuei and the Earth King- dom. Though most Council members fear the Grand Secretariat, many secretly remain loyal to the crown they swore to defend.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Dai Li</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A secret police force with a tight grip on Ba Sing Se</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng controls a secret police force called the Dai Li. Orig- inally created and trained by Avatar Kyoshi much to her later regret, the Dai Li were meant to preserve the Earth Kingdom’s cultural heritage and traditions. Now, they use hypnosis to brain- wash people in the facility hidden underneath Lake Laogai and act as spies for Long Feng.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Dai Li are chosen at a young age and molded into the perfect secret agents, making it difficult, though not impossible, to sway their loyalties. One of the Dai Li’s signature techniques is the use of rock gloves to restrain their opponents and pin them against surfaces. It’s extremely difficult to break free from these restraints for anyone except Earthbenders. Anyone who breaks the illusion that “There is no war in Ba Sing Se” is a potential target for the Dai Li. Likewise, the Dai Li may try to intimidate anyone seen associ- ating with suspected dissidents into acting as informants.</p>

<a name="bookmark86">King Kuei</a>
</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">You’ll notice King Kuei is absent from our list of notable figures. If you want to deal with the Earth King during the Hundred Year War Era, you’re actually dealing with Long Feng. King Kuei is the 52<span class="s50">nd </span>Earth King, and while he has technically been on the throne since he was four years old, he does not actually do much ruling. Grand Secretariat Long Feng has made all decisions on his behalf since Kuei was a child, and the king doesn’t much mind it since he has no idea that there is a war going on. In fact, King Kuei has never even left the premises of the Royal Palace. Right now, King Kuei’s main concerns are keeping himself amused, growing his menagerie, throwing parties, and pampering his best friend, a pet bear named Bosco.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jet and the Freedom Fighters</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A group of rebels determined to destroy the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Freedom Fighters are a group of young Earth Kingdom refugees ostensibly dedicated to protecting the Earth Kingdom. This means ridding the world of any and all Fire Nation citizens that cross their path—the Fighters’ mission of protection often becoming one of vengeance. Though composed entirely of kids, the group stands their own against trained Fire Army soldiers and ambushes their troops to cut off their supply lines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part34.htm#bookmark88" class="s25">Led by a charismatic and manipulative boy named Jet whose parents were murdered by the Rough Rhinos (page 65),</a> the Freedom Fighters include Smellerbee, Longshot, Pipsqueak, the Duke, Sneers, and several others who have joined them over time. Their secret base is located in a network of treehouses obscured by foliage in the woods near a western Earth Kingdom village, Gaipan. The fighters take their lead from Jet, who is ruthless in his quest to destroy the Fire Nation. He is the most willing to kill defenseless Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom civil- ians alike if it brings down the Fire Army as well.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Mechanist</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A brilliant inventor in servitude to the Fire Nation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part18.htm#bookmark59" class="s25">The Mechanist is an Earth Kingdom refugee living in the North- ern Air Temple (page 26)</a> with a number of other refugees, including his son, Teo. Before coming to the temple, his village was destroyed by a flood that killed his wife and paralyzed his son from the waist down. Along with the other survivors, the Mecha- nist discovered the Northern Air Temple, where they still reside.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a genius inventor, the Mechanist was inspired by the tem- ple and the Airbenders who once lived there. He built gliders that allowed his people to fly, including a chair glider for Teo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though the group first lived there in secret, the Fire Nation dis- covered them and coerced the Mechanist into building weapons for the Fire Nation. Though the Mechanist hates helping the Fire Nation, he creates new inventions for their war effort, knowing that the other refugees and his son would suffer if he refused.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There Is No War in Ba Sing Se</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Survival and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Dai Li have a secret underground base they use to brainwash Earth Kingdom dissidents. If anyone discovers the seriousness of the war outside of Ba Sing Se, if any refugee dares speak of what’s outside the city’s walls, or if someone rises to enough prominence and causes trouble for the Dai Li—they’re sent away to be “re-educated” under Lake Laogai. Likewise, a person who makes enemies out of Long Feng might find themselves captured by the Dai Li and brought to the base. During the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">re-education process, victims are forced to look at a bright flashing light while the phrase “there is no war in Ba Sing Se” is repeated by a Dai Li agent. Once brainwashed into forgetting about the war, the person is released back into their old life.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corruption in Ba Sing Se</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Morals Being Tested</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long Feng isn’t the only nefarious authority figure in Ba Sing Se. There are also lesser government officials equally as corrupt. These politicians wield no small amount of local power, which they abuse as the mood strikes them. Politics in Ba Sing Se is a viper’s nest rife with danger; sometimes government officials conspire together to take down a joint rival, and sometimes they compete with each other to better their own political position through back-stabbing. However, these tenuous ties between people in power can also work in the heroes’ favor—perhaps one of the Council of Five could be convinced to work against Long Feng’s orders or a government official could be bribed to do the right thing; either way, someone meddling in politics should tread carefully, because the citizens of the Earth King- dom have internalized that it’s always the common people who suffer the most and pay the price for the corruption in the city.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Nation Colonies</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Colonization in Progress</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tensions are high in regions of the Earth Kingdom where Fire Nation colonists and Earth Kingdom civilians live side by side. Though some communities have merged over time like the city of Yu Dao where Earth Kingdom locals and Fire Nation colo- nists created new families together, it hardly means peaceful rela- tions. Some Earth Kingdom civilians resent their colonizer fam- ily members, friends, and neighbors who they view as foreign, despising other Earth Kingdom citizens who’ve embraced them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For others, a merged life is the only one they’ve ever known and they’ve built their whole lives upon that foundation. Those unhappy with the current arrangement, no matter their origin, find ways to make life unbearable for their neighbors under the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nose of Fire Nation troops—they sabotage crops, socially isolate families, and refuse to trade with anyone they see as “other.”</p>
