<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trouble is brewing in Republic City—First Gentleman Varrick has been kidnapped, and a conspiracy is afoot! For the last two decades, Wakkanai—a Southern Water Tribe business magnate and inventor—has managed Republic City’s water treatment plants on behalf of the city government. Yet it now appears</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that the Utilities Commission is poised to award the water management rights to San Ho, a mysterious Earth Kingdom businessman! President Zhu Li Moon is sure San Ho has rigged the situation…and she strongly suspects he might even have something to do with Varrick’s recent disappearance. Can the heroes discover what Varrick has to do with this dastardly plot and stop San Ho’s machinations before it is too late?</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using This Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The contents of this adventure create a sandbox for your PCs, a setting in which they can choose any path they’d like to move the story forward. Some of the tools available to you are found in these sections:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Summary” provides an outline of the adventure and explains the nature of San Ho’s schemes and Varrick’s disappearance, and the likely problems facing the PCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “The Clock” explains the pressure the PCs are under to learn the truth of San Ho’s plans and find Varrick, including what happens if they are delayed in their search.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The “Introduction” brings the PCs into the story and sets up your group to undertake the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Characters &amp; Groups” provides information on NPCs the heroes might meet throughout Republic City.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• “Important Locations” features different areas for the PCs to explore in Republic City during the adventure and explains where important characters might be found.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “GM Advice” contains additional guidance just for the GM and gives advice on how this adventure could end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Pregenerated Characters” is a set of five premade characters your players can use to hop right into the adventure. We also include a hook that ties the characters to the adventure.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">No Path to the End?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are used to running adventures with heavily detailed encounters and prepared NPCs, it might come as a surprise that few mechanics are written into this adventure, beyond the esca- lations and some information about various characters. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>relies on players triggering moves based on the actions they take during play instead of asking players to make any specific checks for specific actions required by the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since every significant action a PC takes drives the action of the game forward, <b>there is no prescribed order of events</b>. Instead, the adventure puts the PCs in a dramatic starting situ-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ation that demands immediate action from the heroes! It’s your job to use the material in this adventure to keep things moving, providing interesting events and NPCs to consistently engage your players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about running <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game </span>in the core book, <b>Chapter 8: Running the Game</b>, and more about how moves shape play in <b>Chapter 3: Funda- mentals of Play</b>.</p>

<span class="s10">Using the Pregenerated Characters </span>
<a href="part160.htm#bookmark371" class="s25">There are five pregenerated characters included with this adven- ture, starting on page 182.</a> Each character has a unique history, playbook, and set of stats. Your players can use these characters to play through this adventure, or they can create their own as explained in the <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The pregenerated characters have their moves, feature ele- ments, and techniques already chosen; players need only decide whether to shift their balance by one step at the start of play, and which principle to shift it toward. Players can adjust the pregen- erated characters to make themselves more comfortable, altering names, look, and even mechanical elements like the stat boosted by the free +1 at character creation if they are familiar enough to make that choice. The characters are designed to work well with the current elements included and the adventure as presented, but as always, if the GM and player agree then they can make changes as desired. After selecting the pregenerated characters, players will still go through the process of filling out connections with each other.</p>
