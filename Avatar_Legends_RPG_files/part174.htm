<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Use Legends</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legendary characters are special NPCs in <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Compared to most NPCs, they are exceed- ingly powerful and capable on a mechanical level. If they did get into a tussle with the PCs, they have so much fatigue, so many conditions, and long enough balance tracks that they might individually pose a real challenge to entire groups of PCs, all on their own. Such mechanical potency represents their incredible skills and abilities, but it also ensures the role that these figures are meant to play. They are best used as powerful allies, capable teachers, or dangerous long-term foes.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Powerful Allies</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sometimes, the best use of a legendary NPC is as a powerful ally who supports the PCs. The key to legendary NPCs fulfilling this role is that they enable the PCs to take other action, instead of simply solving the problem in the PCs’ own stead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When a legendary NPC holds off an entire army so that the PCs can go and face the real enemy, that feels awesome and cool—the legendary NPC gets to show off a bit, but the PCs still have plenty of interesting work to do, and a real challenge to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">overcome. If the reverse happens, the PCs holding off an army so the legendary NPC can go and face the real enemy, that can still feel fun depending upon the players and their choices—if they buy in to the idea or even propose it themselves, then they can still feel that it respected their coolness. Be cautious, however, about the PCs getting to satisfying conclusions for their stories and arcs—if it’s important that the heroes face off against their own dire foe, then the legendary NPC shouldn’t steal their thun- der and do it for them!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The worst case scenario is that the legendary NPC deals with both problems all on their own, without the PCs’ input. Keep in mind that using a legendary NPC as an ally should only ever al- low the PCs to do something else interesting, cool, and exciting, instead of solving all their problems for them.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Capable Teachers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legendary NPCs are very, very capable. They’ve mastered their trainings thoroughly, and they likely have a whole enormous array of different techniques at their disposal. Many of them are also masters of special forms of bending like metalbending and lightningbending, forms they can guide PCs to learn. All of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">which means that there’s a good chance they’re some of the best teachers the heroes are ever likely to find!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Different legendary NPCs always have different ways of teaching, different lessons they would try to convey, different requests they would make of their students to help push the learning forward. But they are always capable of teaching the techniques, even if there is a hiccup or two along the way, even if the NPC wouldn’t believe that they are a good teacher all on their own. Use the basic training move in the core book on page 212 for training and the rules for learning special forms of bend- ing on page 217 of the core book—they both work as normal with a legendary NPC teacher.</p>
