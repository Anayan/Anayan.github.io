<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The PCs already know what path is generally the safest and fastest way to reach Ba Sing Se from the coast. Between them and their destination are countless Fire Nation patrols and rebels who will earthbend first and ask questions later; however, based on all available knowledge and strategy, the course they’ve plotted is their best option. These locations are listed in order of the proposed course—you can use them one after another as the PCs move forward. If time is an issue, however, or if some seem more interesting than others, feel free to skip some locations when you play. The key is that the PCs don’t have to make a choice about where to go next; they know where the next loca- tion on the path is. If they make any other choice, then they’re choosing danger over safety and speed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Under each location, you’ll find some advice on how to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">use that location. The suggested escalation is there to create a situation of greater tension and impact—if things are slowing down because the PCs don’t have some other direction or goal in one of these locations, use the suggested escalation to amp up the tension!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">West Heiatu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">West Heiatu is a long-established Fire Nation colony in the Earth Kingdom. The heroes are familiar with the colony, having visited briefly on their way to collect Onomu. Earth Kingdom citizens go about their business with seemingly peaceful lives even though Fire Nation soldiers regularly patrol there—es- pecially the most crowded city spots like the main square, the market, and the largest teahouse. West Heiatu is a functional colony, but on the heroes’ journey to Ba Sing Se, they arrive to witness a case of oppression and injustice. When the players arrive in town ask the following questions to give the players an emotional tie-in to the scene:</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Last time you were in town, you had a cup of tea at the Steeping Phoenix before heading on your way. You met the owner of the teahouse, who sat down and had a cup of tea with you.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What’s the owner’s name and what do they look like? What’s a quirk of theirs? What trained animal companion helps them run the teahouse?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What did you do to endear yourselves to the owner?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• What complicated trouble was the owner complaining of while drinking tea with you?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve established the PCs’ connection to the owner, de- scribe what they happen upon right now: a band of Fire Nation soldiers stand outside the Steeping Phoenix berating the owner. The soldiers are angry because they’ve discovered the owner was charging them more than Earth Kingdom citizens. If the players don’t intervene, the Fire Nation soldiers will oust all the Steeping Phoenix’s patrons and spend the entire day forcing the owner to serve them, eating and drinking their fill, and destroy- ing the property. People in town turn a blind eye to the destruc- tion for fear of incurring the wrath of the soldiers.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Suggested Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In response to the Fire Nation soldiers’ threats and occupation of the Steeping Phoenix, the Armadillo-Bears attack. Ben Ta has them prepare for a wide-scale fight, planting explosives and traps before attacking the soldiers directly in the Steeping Phoenix.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unless quickly contained, the conflict will inevitably spill out into a city-wide attack against the Fire Nation. The PCs get to see the Armadillo-Bears in action right in front of them. Led by Rameh or by Ben Ta, the Bears attack the Fire Nation soldiers, and a storm of fire and stone ensues between the two groups.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs don’t intervene at all, the chaos will end up hurting innocent civilians, including the owner of the Steeping Phoenix, who suffers a major, lasting injury in the crossfire between the Fire Nation soldiers and the Armadillo-Bears.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs stay in town long enough, they’ll see the conse- quence of the rebels’ attack: a fresh, larger contingent of Fire Nation soldiers and officers will fill the streets of this once some- how functional colony. The new arrivals bring in new orders: to rule the place with an iron fist and crush any sign of dissidence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">So Bai Oasis</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The So Bai Oasis is further inland in the Earth Kingdom, where many small communities are scattered over the land. The Fire Nation invaders are spread thin trying to cover the most polit- ically important places, so they tend to leave this sort of place alone. As such, inhabitants of the Oasis have only heard of the horrors others have endured. Maybe they’ve received some refugees, but according to the popular wisdom of the place, “it’s better to stay away from a conflict one cannot win.” The Fire Nation is just too powerful to oppose by way of arms; instead, the inhabitants of this little oasis in the middle of a war prefer survival as their form of resistance.</p>

</p>
<p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(Order #33868734)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The oasis itself is a balmy collection of wooden houses and outdoor squares centered around a natural lake. It seems to be a perfect place for the PCs and Onomu to get some rest. Most of the locals receive them kindly, and the villagers won’t recognize Onomu as a former Fire Nation general without something prompting them. As a result, this may very well be the first place in which the heroes can truly be themselves without worrying about either the Earth Kingdom naturals or the Fire Nation invaders bothering them. Or so it seems at first…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Here are some more names for the village’s inhabitants:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Pung</b>, a local food merchant, conniving and cunning but useful to PCs on a longer trek</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Ba</b>, the Earth Kingdom magistrate for the Oasis, de jure head of the town but actually quite content to do nothing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Moluo</b>, the only Earth Kingdom militia guard left in the Oasis, who’d like nothing better than to leave and get involved in the war, but she feels obligated to remain and protect her home</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Suggested Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs dawdle or spend too much time at the Oasis, the Rough Rhinos catch up and attack! They’ve been following Onomu’s trail straight to the village. The Rhinos care very little for innocent bystanders and will tear the Oasis apart looking for Onomu and the war plans.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs decide to fight the Rhinos, as soon as more than half of the Rough Rhinos are defeated, the remaining members take their fallen comrades and try to run away. Whoever is still up uses their technique to prevent the PCs from stopping their escape, or they try to create other dangerous situations for the PCs to handle, such as lighting fires that need to be put out throughout the village or threatening the civilians.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Xiadi</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The heart of the Earth Kingdom is a dangerous place, with bands of Fire Nation soldiers roving the land and rebels attacking var- ious outposts. Traveling overland or by river is near impossible, putting the PCs in danger of facing large patrols of soldiers and various checkpoints. The way to avoid all this is to travel to and through the rebel stronghold of Xiadi.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Xiadi is a secret rebel base deep in the earth. The chamber that houses Xiadi is a massive sphere of stone and earth, lit by countless glowworm jars. The base itself was earthbent in blocky, utilitarian form—it’s designed to be functional, not pretty. The structures aren’t packed with people, but a steady susurrus of activity carries on throughout its roads. A series of underground tunnels connects this place to various key locations throughout the land. Thanks to the tunnels, Fire Nation soldiers have yet to find the base and discover why the Earth Kingdom rebels are so quick and accurate in their attacks. This stronghold is a danger- ous location to bring a former Fire Nation general, but it is also one of the safest waypoints to get across a large swath of land awash with Fire Nation patrols.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Armadillo-Bears aren’t the only rebels who travel through Xiadi, but they know the tunnels and the secret base well. The PCs either know of Xiadi thanks to their own back- grounds, or thanks to some tips passed to them by Long Feng’s agents. In either case, they know that traveling through Xiadi is the safest and fastest way to get closer to Ba Sing Se…but it’s still not exactly safe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Getting into Xiadi is just a matter of looking for the correct signs in the environment, hidden markers showing the opening of a secret tunnel. Getting out of Xiadi without Onomu being captured, on the other hand, is difficult. It could require forging a deep bond with Rameh or Ben Ta and asking for help or understanding. Another option would be trying to sneak or run through; although, doing so as outsiders and with Onomu is exceedingly difficult—almost any rebel in Xiadi would recognize Onomu if they got a clear look at her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs successfully turn the rebels’ hearts, they may use the tunnels, at least to get out to anywhere they want in the Earth Kingdom. Traveling through such tunnels in such</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">conditions is an almost risk-free proposition, which could allow the PCs to reach the outskirts of Ba Sing Se safely in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are a few rebel characters who populate Xiadi:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Yan</b>, the commander of Xiadi, is a scarred, grizzled soldier with a boisterous temperament. Yan isn’t actually interested in fighting anymore, but he still knows that the Earth Kingdom needs to be freed from the Fire Nation. He would be amenable to helping the PCs, knowing Onomu would be a boon to the Earth Kingdom and that getting her out of Xiadi would prevent violence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Losha</b>, a local healer and medic for the rebels of Xiadi, is tired of standing by the sidelines while she sees soldier after soldier hurt by the fighting. If she recognizes Onomu, she’ll tip off the Armadillo-Bears and lead the charge for vengeance on the Fire Nation general.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <b>Aro</b>, a Fire Nation spy hidden among the rebels, will try to get out and alert the Rough Rhinos or other Fire Nation soldiers as soon as he sees Onomu. But to do that, he’ll try to create chaos first—setting off explosives or causing any kind of commotion to hold up the PCs while he slips away for help.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Suggested Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ben Ta and a cadre of Armadillo-Bears find Onomu and demand she be handed over for “interrogation.” Ben Ta makes a spectacle out of the situation, a performance of justice in front of the other rebels. If the PCs let Ben Ta take Onomu, Ben Ta will interro- gate the defector for all the information she can get and throw the former general in a windowless cell for the rest of her days.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Fighting the large number of rebels present at Xiadi is a fruit- less endeavor; the PCs can defeat groups of rebels, but not take on the entire underground city, so if they make enemies, they’ll most likely need to run or surrender and plead their way to safe- ty. Running is not without hope, and the rebels respect courage. Showing a display of bravery in the face of overwhelming odds helps the PCs’ cause, making the rebels generally more prone to listening to them if the heroes decide they want to talk later on.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taking a Riskier Path</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">There’s always a chance the heroes want to risk going overland travel even though they know Xiadi is the safer option. If they make this decision, it’s possible, but it’s fraught with danger and difficulty. For example, while traveling overland they could be attacked by Fire Nation soldiers and the Rough Rhi- nos at the same time. Use the escalations in “GM Advice” as an example of what you can do.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">To represent how arduous the journey is, you should also <b>inﬂict fatigue</b>. This represents their in- ability to rest during their travel and grows the need to flee to the next location as quickly as possible to rest and recuperate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Laoshan</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Laoshan is a small mining community, which is relatively safe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to pass through, because the bulk of Fire Nation soldiers are sta- tioned at the mine, not the town itself. A majority of the mine’s workers are forced laborers, and the others are villagers so poor that they are dependent on the measly income they get from the seized mine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As a result, many Earth Kingdom people live here in terrible conditions, working from early day to late at night to the point of exhaustion. Any spark of rebellion has been worked out of the villagers, who barely notice the PCs or Onomu. A few Fire Nation guards are in the village proper, but they’re nothing the heroes can’t avoid or move around.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">General Sheng oversees the village, and unlike the soldiers who sleep in tents near the mines, the General lives in the former mayor’s home—which he confiscated. After the former mayor, Shi To, attempted a coup with a few loyal villagers (who are now laborers in the mines), he was located at the center of town in stockades—a reminder to the rest of the village that rebellion is futile.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There’s a chance the players may see the condition of the village and villagers and want to do something about the mines nearby.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part140.htm#bookmark349" class="s25">This isn’t impossible, but they’ll likely face a fight against the Fire Nation soldiers and Sheng, who will try to defend the mines. In this case, you can use the stat blocks on page 127,</a> with the “Fire Nation captain” stat block for Sheng. If the players defeat the sol- diers, the town and mines are liberated…for now. The PCs should feel the press of their mission and the need to get Onomu to Ba Sing Se enough to move on before resolving everything here, but it’s clear that if a long-term solution isn’t found for the town, it’ll just be occupied again. The Fire Nation knows about the mine and its valuable ore; they won’t just leave it alone.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Suggested Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Onomu sees a lot of herself in General Sheng’s rule, sees Shi To, and feels a pang of guilt. When she has a moment, she sneaks away from the group and frees the mayor. If the players don’t intervene, she’s spotted by Sheng who defeats her in single com- bat, takes her prisoner, and plans to send her back to the Fire Nation with an armed guard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">An Outpost of Ba Sing Se</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the outpost the players were instructed to bring the war plans to in the “Introduction.” The small outpost serves as one of many places Long Feng uses to keep an eye on Fire Nation troop movements. The outpost itself is a tall stone structure with a number of lifts and exits that can only be operated with earthbending. It’s not a defensive outpost so much as a look- out station for Earth Kingdom soldiers to know when the Fire Nation is coming. When the heroes arrive, it is empty save for Yanran and a cadre of Dai Li agents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This is the final location where the players will decide what happens to Onomu, the plans, and a possible future alliance with Long Feng, as explained in the “Summary.” Yanran wants the plans but not Onomu, and while he’ll try to convince the PCs to go along with his wishes, he’ll fight if he has to.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Suggested escalation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One or more of the groups chasing the PCs make a last-ditch attempt to capture Onomu, be it the Rough Rhinos, the Arma- dillo-Bears, or both.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs don’t interfere:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If the Armadillo-Bears are there, then Ben Ta leads the Armadillo-Bears in one last attempt to capture Onomu. Yanran sees what is happening and attacks the PCs to keep them distracted. In the chaos, Ben Ta is overzealous in her attacks and accidentally kills Onomu with a stone, pushing Ben Ta directly into imbalance and turning her from a freedom fighter into a terrorist, just as brutal as her enemy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If the Rough Rhinos are there, then they are content not to take captives, but instead to destroy everything and everyone. They’ll depart once Onomu and Yanran are both dealt with.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• If both groups are there, then both events happen—Ben Ta crushes Onomu accidentally, and the Rough Rhinos destroy the rest of the Armadillo-Bears and the Dai Li.</p>
