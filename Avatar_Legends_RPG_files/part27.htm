<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Roku Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation in this era is generally stable and more or less united. Internal conflicts, like the Camellia-Peony War of the Ky- oshi Era, haven’t stricken the nation for decades, and Fire Lord Sozin’s ascension to the throne was painless and uncontested.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation has spent decades focusing on internal matters, and with a new Fire Lord on the throne, the people have begun to look beyond their borders. As Sozin has stated many times, the Fire Nation has so much to offer the world and it is time they start sharing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation’s burgeoning outward interest is represented in a number of ways. They’re focused on developing faster and better forms of transportation (specifically via coal power) to bring the rest of the world closer than ever. Sozin jump-started his nation’s development of coal-powered vessels and created hundreds of jobs for the poorest members of society, building his great fleet. Materials for the fleet are scarce and the Fire Nation has come into political conflict with the Earth Kingdom on numerous occasions over resources, which Sozin has quietly used to stoke anti-Earth Kingdom sentiment in his nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite any political machinations, scholars and diplomats attempt to open relations with other nations and share mutually beneficial technologies with one another to further Fire Nation knowledge. While the Fire Lord encourages his people to drink deep from the well of knowledge in other nations, within his borders he tries to preserve Fire Nation culture. The largest road- block to this is the younger nobles, many of whom now seek out Air Nomads to guide them on the principles of enlightenment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part26.htm#bookmark71" class="s25">The Air Nomads have gone so far as to build an Air Nomad center of learning within the Fire Nation (page 46)</a> with funds from Fire Nation nobles. As a small offshoot of Air Nomads called the Guiding Wind have caused trouble with the building of the temple, Sozin has sent his military guard to the location to protect the local population—a move hailed with great respect by many of the common folk on the islands who question the Guiding Wind’s motives.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Sozin</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A competent ruler with imperial ambitions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Sozin ascended to the throne, he was eager to make a name for himself. His father, a staunch traditionalist, allowed the Fire Nation’s internal politics to proceed as they had for decades. Sozin struck a more aggressive stance in relation to the Fire Nation nobility. He quashed the remaining internal fighting between families, and now works to secure their loyalty to the crown through political channels. One major roadblock has been some of the nobles’ embrace of Air Nomad ideals, spear- headed by Sozin’s sister Zeisan, which infuriates him to no end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To counteract his sister’s influence, he’s begun nationalistic propaganda campaigns targeting the poorest members of soci-</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ety. He’s generous to those less fortunate and wins people over by providing food, shelter, and work, which are all dependent on his success as Fire Lord. Sozin can be a strong ally, but he’s deeply nationalistic and has his eyes set beyond the Fire Nation. He always conducts himself with intelligence and an odd warmth, but underneath his veneer of decorum is a fiery inferno of unbridled ambition.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Zeisan</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A chi-blocking princess working to undo her family’s corruption <span class="p">Zeisan was born without firebending and spent her childhood pitted against her brother Sozin to prove her worthiness. To survive her family, she devoted herself to Air Nomad training under Sister Rioshon, who taught her many things including chi-blocking. Zeisan shares her brother’s intensity and doubts her own ability to be good, but is focused on dismantling her family’s corruption.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part28.htm#bookmark75" class="s25">During training, Zeisan and Rioshon fell in love, but their pair- ing was not advantageous to Zeisan’s dynasty-toppling ambitions. Instead, she has just announced her intention to marry Khandro of the Guiding Wind (page 50)</a> and wishes to renounce her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">titles and wealth in favor of a spiritual life. Her example is popular enough that other young nobles now vow the same, and Zeisan senses in the Guiding Wind the destabilizing element she needs to undermine her brother. The princess can be a powerful ally to any hero needing political help against the Fire Nation or a boost to escape trouble with Fire Nation nobility.</p>

<a name="bookmark74">General Oraso Eiko</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A famous general who wants the Fire Nation isolated</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Oraso Eiko, a decorated military leader, led the united Fire Nation troops in the last real conflict between the clans</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the name of the new Fire Lord Sozin. Thanks to her know- how, she won the battle and the nation finally united under the throne. Now, the general supports the Fire Lord’s internal ini- tiative to build infrastructure and provide jobs to the populace, but questions the expense of a Fire Nation fleet. Why not remain isolated and prosperous? There has to be something more here, but the general is not sure she wants to find out. The general respects anyone coming from a military background and could ask for those heroes’ help when Fire Nation interests are at stake.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Sage Kaja</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A friendly, spiritual man devoted to the Avatar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kaja is committed to the cause of balance and service of the Avatar. After helping Roku master the Avatar State, he remains a staunch supporter of the Avatar. Internally, Kaja works with his fellow Fire Sages to preserve Fire Nation spirituality and often serves as advisor to the Fire Lord on these matters. Unlike Sozin, Kaja is unworried about the Air Nomads’ influence on Fire Nation nobility. Fads have a way of coming and going among the rich; his focus is on maintaining tradition for future generations. Kaja is concerned with what he sees from his own nation’s subtle moves, but he does not wish to distract the Avatar from import- ant international work. Kaja could ask heroes for help getting to the bottom of the Fire Nation’s international activities or ensur- ing the Avatar’s will is carried out in the Fire Nation.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uzuku Yuyan</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A legendary markswoman transforming archery into art</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uzuku Yuyan is an astonishing markswoman. Firing an arrow from a bow is no mere physical act; it is spiritual, requiring perfect harmony between archer and arrow. She transformed her archery into an art form, and many a noble has sponsored her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in exchange for demonstrations and lessons. Now, Uzuku faces pressure to share her incredible skills with the Fire Nation. Some want her as one of the nation’s deadliest agents; others want her to teach new archers her incredible skills. She feels a loyalty to her homeland, but is conflicted—they seek to change her artistic gifts into crass violence. Heroes might find a teacher with her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or they might find an ally if they can convince her to take new action with regard to her homeland.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nyn Chei</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An idealist inventor who embraces the power of coal</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nyn is a brilliant technologist who has provided much design and invention for the Fire Nation’s coal-powered fleet. She has a real hope for connecting the world, believing her ships will unite the nations and lead to greater academic discourse. To that end she’s reached out to fellow inventors from all nations in hopes</p>

<a href="part29.htm#bookmark78" class="s25">of collaboration after her falling out with her former lover and fellow inventor Massak (page 53).</a> Heroes could seek Nyn out if they need help building the impossible or for a smart solution to a difficult situation. Likewise, Nyn needs materials from all over the world and could ask some heroes to aid her.</p>

<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Internal Conflicts vs. External Problems</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roku’s activation of the Crescent Island volcano caused seismic instability in the surrounding islands. People are still working on rebuilding and the Avatar is regularly seen around these islands when he has a moment to spare from his normal duties. People on these islands are desperate to rebuild some form of stabil-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part30.htm#bookmark80" class="s25">ity in their lives and Sozin’s anti-Earth Kingdom propaganda campaigns in the islands work. It’s much easier for people on the islands to blame the Earth Kingdom for their problems, rather than looking too deeply at what their own nation is (or isn’t) doing for them. Instead, people blame the Earth Kingdom’s lack of support and their greedy claim to Natsuo Island (page 55).</a>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Princess and the Fire Lord</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Testing Alliances</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Princess Zeisan is earnest in her plan to give up her riches and rank for a life of poverty and service, even though such an act would greatly frustrate her family. However, she knows that when Sozin is angry he gets sloppy—maybe she can trick him into revealing his schemes to her. She’s seen Sozin’s avarice first hand and knows it’s only a matter of time until he makes a big move to show off his power. Political backstabbing isn’t in line with the Air Nomad ideals she tries to adhere to…but she’s will- ing to abide this evil if it means she can ultimately do good.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sozin was blindsided by his sister’s relationship with the Guiding Wind’s leader Khandro and nearly couldn’t control his rage when she proposed marriage to the monk. He sees the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guiding Wind’s anti-nobility beliefs as a direct threat to him and is determined to stop her by any means necessary. He’s fought with Zeisan for as long as he can remember and now that he is Fire Lord he refuses to back down.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dragons in Danger</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Propaganda and Secrets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Many members of the nobility now seek a dragon to hunt, kill, and gain legendary firebending abilities from its death. Bolstered by Sozin’s leadership, many see the dragon hunts as a right bequeathed to them by the benevolence of the Fire Lord and their own nobility. The dragon hunts have caused numerous ethical debates between the nobility and spiritual leaders, but the most unexpected result of the hunts has been the imbalance created within the Spirit World.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Spirits seem drawn to the locations where dragons die and strange occurrences abound around those sites. Luckily, most of the deaths have occurred away from populated areas and Sozin has been quick to send his taskforce to clean up any “messes” left by the hunt. However, the imbalance created by the deaths has even drawn a joint envoy from the Water Tribes who sensed the disturbance. The envoy has faced a number of issues when inves- tigating the death sites, most disturbingly a propaganda cam- paign by Sozin, which blames the spiritual activity on <i>their </i>visits rather than the other way around. Many Fire Nation citizens mistrust the tribespeople and refuse to help them investigate, seeing them as nuisances and trouble-makers.</p>
