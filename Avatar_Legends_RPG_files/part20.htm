<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you have a basic understanding of the Avatarverse, let’s look at the rest of this chapter—the eras. Each era is named after the Avatar who lived during that time, with the exception of the Hundred Year War when the Avatar was missing. Rather than focusing on the history of the entire world, <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>zooms in on a timespan within each era to give you gameable information to use while you play:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Kyoshi Era </span>covers the events right after <i>The Shadow of Kyoshi </i>novel. Play in the Kyoshi Era if you want to fight in battles against rogues and bandits and deal with governmental cor- ruption as the nations establish their borders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s23" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roku Era <span class="p">covers the time right after Sozin became Fire Lord and before Roku mar- ried. Play in the Roku Era if you want to deal with tensions between different nations and the trials of maintaining an uneasy peace.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Hundred Year War Era </span>focuses on the time just before Avatar Aang’s awakening at the beginning of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Hundred Year War Era if you want to rebel against unjust rule, protect the weak, and stand up to tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Aang Era </span>is set after the events of the <i>Imbalance </i>comics trilogy, some time after the end of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Aang Era if you want to heal the world after tragedy and help push it into a brighter future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Korra Era </span>covers a period that takes place after the events of the <i>Ruins of the Empire </i>comic trilogy, some time after the end of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. Play in the Korra Era if you want to deal with the repercussions of imperi- alism and play in a modernized era.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Breakdown</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Each era is laid out in the same way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Where We Start</span>—Each era as outlined in this book takes place during a specific time in history. This section pinpoints exactly when that time is and what transpired just before it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Avatar Information</span>—The impact of the Avatar’s actions and reputation is felt throughout the entire world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This section covers the life, deeds, and public view of the current Avatar up to that point in the timeline.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Significant Themes</span>
<a href="part93.htm#bookmark227" class="s25">—Different eras lend themselves particularly well to exploring specific themes. This section outlines them and gives suggestions for how to incorporate some of those themes into an adventure. Each theme has three linked GM moves that directly engage with the theme. GM moves are explained on page 229,</a> but are included here for ease of reference.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Important Events</span>—Each time period is shaped by the events that led up to that point. This section expands on the information in “Where We Start” and covers some of the most important recent events that have influenced that era. It also lists the direct consequences of each historical event that you’ll tackle in your game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">The Four Nations</span>—Each era has an overview of every nation which includes: its history in the given era, notable figures in the era who helped shape the world, and threats and challenges you could face while exploring, which directly link to the themes of the era. The Four Nations are presented in the Avatar reincarnation order—fire, air, water, earth—with the nation of the current Avatar first.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adventures Set in Different Periods <span class="p">Each era section in this chapter details the state of the world during a specific time within those eras. But what if you want to play a game set during another time in the era?</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can use that era section as a baseline to work from and make adjustments from there, referring to the era that comes before or after for more information. For instance, if you want to set a game during the Siege of Ba Sing Se, you could use the Hundred Year War Era section as your foundation and refer to the following Aang Era section to help fill in the gaps. You can even decide that the adventure takes place in an alternate time- line so that it’s okay if the characters end up changing the course of history as seen in the shows. Just make sure that everyone playing agrees with that choice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, you could set a game in the future and explore the era of the Avatar that comes after Korra, though be prepared for some trickier worldbuilding since you’ll have to make some big decisions about how the world has changed in that time!</p>
