</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Below are some suggested locations, including which importan NPCs might be found at each. Feel free to have your players en- counter these in any order or even “reskin” locations as needed. For example, a hideout in Boat Bottom could be found in an- other coastal town or even in Yu Dao with a few simple changes.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each location in the plains and mountains has enough oil or coal to refill the tanks on the dirigible <span class="p">even if not expressly stated in the write-up. While under Fire Nation rule, this area of</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the Earth Kingdom mined and refined many of the materials the Fire Nation used to build its war balloons, and those supplies are still abundant in these towns and outposts.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Boat Bottom</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The adventure starts in Boat Bottom, a fishing village named for the central building, constructed out of the hulk of a derelict vessel. Boat Bottom is situated on the coast of the western Earth Kingdom. In general, Boat Bottom has managed to survive on its own for some time, even through the onslaught of the Hundred Year War. It never grew large enough to demand any kind of serious occupation from the Fire Nation, and even after the Fire Nation’s withdrawal, life in Boat Bottom has remained much the same. Now, though, everything stands to change as larger corpo- rations are looking to move into the town and build something anew. The activity keeping Boat Bottom abuzz is well out of character with the normally small, quiet place, but the locals are pretty happy about it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Jelly Shack</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qian Yu has been hiding right underneath Sparrowkeet Air’s nose or, more accurately, right underneath Boat Bottom’s hottest destination. Named the town’s top lobster-crab chowder restau- rant of the year by the <i>Boat Bottom Tribune </i>and the <i>Boat Bottom Junior Academy Gazette</i>, this diner near the docks is run by a hap- py couple simply called Mrs. and Mrs. Jelly by locals. The dining area is small and homey, filled with cobbled together driftwood stools and a countertop just slightly uneven, enough to make the Jelly Shack’s precious chowder spill if you’re not careful. Remov- ing the panel in the back of the kitchen closet reveals stairs that lead down to the diner’s hidden basement where Mrs. and Mrs. Jelly store their chowder’s secret ingredient: jelly-nemone. The distinct and pervasive smell almost masks the other important substance they keep in the basement—dirigible fuel. Mrs. and Mrs. Jelly used to run quite the little sabotage ring, stealing and hiding barrels of the stuff while under Fire Nation rule. That makes them perfect suppliers for the PCs who need to refuel Qian Yu’s dirigible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This place can be found in Boat Bottom as described if the players need to use Qian Yu’s hideout to dodge guards; in that case, she’s been hiding in this aromatic basement for nearly a full week, waiting for Sparrowkeet Air to leave the town. Otherwise, the Jelly Shack is a possible hideout anywhere along the coast. But Qian Yu’s funds have run low, and Mrs. and Mrs. Jelly have bills to pay now that they can’t make money off their stolen goods; they are increasingly likely to tip Sparrowkeet Air to her whereabouts for a big pile of reward money.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Pumpyard</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Pumpyard is an old Fire Nation processing plant. It used to operate at full capacity, producing refined materials and chem- icals for Fire Nation material, but ever since the end of the war it’s been all but abandoned. The technicians necessary to operate the plant either came from the Fire Nation military or weren’t there of their own free will, and they left the place at the end of the war. Sparrowkeet Air and other companies have contemplat- ed putting resources into reviving the Pumpyard here in Boat Bottom, but there are other more lucrative sites to repair first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So it has become a scrapyard, as scavengers take more and more resources and leave it in worse and worse repair. Ume, in particu- lar, likes to hang about the Pumpyard, scrounging for interesting bits. Flint and Ember have also taken to hiding in the Pumpyard. When they steal the artifact from Qian Yu, they take it here, where Ume may catch a glimpse of it.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Dirigible Site</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qian Yu traversed most of the Earth Kingdom in a stolen Sparrowkeet dirigible. Unfortunately, Qian Yu is an archaeolo- gist, not a dirigible pilot, and when she parked the air vehicle… something went terribly wrong and it won’t start when the com- panions arrive. If the companions can fix the dirigible, it is their best bet to reach the Beifong Metalbending Academy swiftly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Alternatively, if the PCs met Ume in Boat Bottom and be- friended her, she’s willing to use her expertise to fix the dirigible for them…perhaps even installing some extra features? Ask your players what features they’d like their airship to have, using your discretion as GM to decide whether those features are possible, and let the players describe how their PCs aid Ume in realizing their suggestions. They can <span class="s11">rely on their skills and training </span>to help, with 7–9 consequences creating possible drawbacks or complications in the new improvements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After the dirigible is repaired, amp up the tension so the PCs leave in a chase! For maximum drama and fun, as the players sail away in their souped-up dirigible, they are pursued by Sparrowkeet Air’s Flying HQ and must use their skills to steer their own airship to escape and/or use the special features they installed if relevant.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Sparrowkeet Air’s Flying HQ</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First seen hovering over the little town of Boat Bottom, this mas- sive green and yellow airship is known throughout the western Earth Kingdom as Sparrowkeet Air HQ, if only because the cor- poration’s logo on the dirigible’s side is larger than most build- ings. Inside, except for the stunning views, you’d never know you were flying, the ship glides so smoothly, and the ship’s patented panel system blocks the rush of air and wind. Instead, clicking footsteps echo down halls that hum pleasant, quiet, bland music from overhead speakers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Sparrowkeet Air HQ dirigible is full of Sparrowkeet Air personnel and guards at all times. It isn’t impossible to escape from the place, but the place is more than formidable enough to fend off nearly any kind of attack. It’s huge and sturdy—even when capable benders try to inflict structural damage on the dirigible, the place is likely to only need to put down for repairs, instead of being rendered totally non-functional. It has redun- dancies upon redundancies, and teams of expert mechanics</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to keep it in the air. In game terms, if the PCs do damage to the Sparrowkeet Air dirigible, then they can give themselves a chance to escape or put some distance between them and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the HQ...but they can’t reliably destroy it or remove the threat entirely just by hurting the dirigible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Because Sparrowkeet Air HQ is both mobile and huge, its om- nipresence in the sky can put the pressure on the party, especially if they decide to travel mostly by air. In those cases, the HQ’s an- chor system, which launches grappling hooks, can be weaponized, or it can launch smaller gliding vessels filled with bounty hunters or mercenaries. Should the players be captured, sneak onto, or otherwise find themselves aboard Sparrowkeet Air HQ, this is an opportunity for them to face Yuzhen Sr. and/or Yuzhen Jr. The former has a large, lush, showy office filled with large, lush, showy decor, while the latter prefers ascetic minimalism. Both of them have emergency buttons they can press within their own offices</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to summon guards and Captain Biho from all across the dirigible. Yuzhen Sr. is likely to press the button as soon as he possibly can, but Yuzhen Jr. might give the heroes more of a chance to talk first, depending upon how they act.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How do I run a dirigible chase scene?</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Invite your players to the table as storytellers, encouraging creativ- ity and descriptive roleplaying as you do with any moves in <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. If players feel stuck, remind them to interact with the environment of the airship. For example, they could <b>trick the Sparrowkeet Air HQ </b>by steering the dirigible around a mountaintop and hiding in the forest while out of sight, they could <b>assess a situation </b>to help the team come up with an escape plan, or they could <b>intimidate the Air HQ </b>with the rockets they asked Ume to install. Rely on the basic moves—they still can resolve most situa- tions of uncertainty, even between two dirigibles!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Plains</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom plains are generally more open expanses, containing rivers, seas of grass, flat dirt stretches, and bounded forests. Towns and villages built on the plains are usually visible from a distance, often abutting some feature or another—it’s useful if a town or village is along a river, or against a mountain, or directly on the edge of a forest. The plains provide challenges in how obvious any travelers are as they cut across the plains— how visible they are from great distances—and just how much distance there is to cross on the plains.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ume’s Workshop</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs don’t have an opportunity to meet Ume elsewhere, Ume’s Workshop is the perfect location to drop into the forest wilderness, a mountain valley, or along a river. The workshop is as quirky as Ume, and the companions probably hear it before they see it: a cacophony of zips and zaps and steam and the occasional small explosion. There’s also the tinkling of wind chimes and whirring weathervanes—Ume loves to know which direction the wind blows.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This mysterious and discordant orchestra tucked into Earth Kingdom plains looks as chaotic as it sounds. Riveted metal pan- els make up the central structure of a massive treehouse, which is surrounded by small tents of mismatched fabrics. A system of platforms, attached to pulleys and thick hemp rope, allows Ume to traverse from tent to tent, branch to branch. She has a tent for every purpose: a breakfast tent, a reading tent, a meditation tent, a tent in which to exclaim success, a meeting tent that rarely gets used. Her most important activity is her work as an inventor and architect, the allocated tent of course being the central metal structure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Ume is willing to trade repairs on the dirigible, or refueling of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">its tanks, in exchange for a look at the artifact. Though, that said, there is always some chance Ume would rather not relinquish the artifact, depending upon what it is and what she learns from it…</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Possible Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While the PCs are relaxing and the dirigible is refueling, Ume decides to be helpful and tinker with the dirigible’s engine—<i>she knows she can make this thing go faster</i>! While she is elbow deep in engine grease, the Snow Rats catch up with the companions and attack! The PCs must defend Ume while she slaps the en- gine back together, otherwise they’re going nowhere fast.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Sparrowkeet Station</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This once-prosperous town was built around a refueling post for Sparrowkeet Air. Inhabited by a blended group of citizens</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">drawn to the area’s prosperity, it’s one of the few locations which did quite well for itself during the war. Since the Fire Nation left the Earth Kingdom and the number of dirigibles has dropped significantly, the town and station have gone belly-up. Most inhabitants left to seek fortune elsewhere and those who stay struggle to keep their community afloat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">More enterprising inhabitants have tapped the former Spar- rowkeet station for fuel, selling canisters to anyone who passes by with enough money to pay. Despite its rickety appearance, the inhabitants of this ghost town come alive when a big spender rolls through. Most who’ve decided to stay happily remember the days of affluence in the town and cling to the idea that Spar- rowkeet Station can once more regain its glory.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The PCs can find refueling here, and their dirigible is met with lots of attention and traders. But if anyone finds out about the artifact, it may be difficult for them to resist the urge to steal an item that might change their life for the better…</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Possible Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yuzhen Jr. rolls into town in a Sparrowkeet-branded carriage drawn by two ostrich-horses looking for the companions. People in town know him from the glory days of Sparrowkeet Station and blame his family for their misfortune. If the players do noth- ing he’s pelted with rotten fruit and flees. In the chaos he runs through a few market stalls causing a lot of damage to actual edible food before leaving town. Yuzhen Jr. doesn’t want to cause any harm to the town, but he won’t be responding with anything but panic if the townspeople attack him.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Earth Kingdom’s mountains can tower over their surround- ings, with snowy tips and terrible winds blasting along their jagged edges. Most of the time, travelers would prefer not to go through the mountains—it’s not exactly the easiest of journeys. But over the years, certain trails have been well-established and maintained. Mountain villages have grown in size and import, especially as they came to offer resources and services that weren’t offered elsewhere in the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Eel-Swan Sauna</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eel-Swan Sauna is located next to a picturesque river around the bend from a clutch of trickling waterfalls. The oldest resort in the area, it prides itself on its history and dignity, but betrays</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hints of better days in layers of peeling paint. The establishment’s owner, Kim, reminisces over the Eel-Swan Sauna’s glory days when he was but a child and the river bend wasn’t so…crowded. Glancing across the water, a <i>tsk tsk </i>signals his displeasure at the latest resort to join the neighborhood before the end of the war: Flameo Hot Springs. While he’d never ask, the Eel-Swan Sauna’s owner wouldn’t mind if someone sabotaged his competition, and if something did happen, he’d offer certain someones free re- fueling from the sauna’s stores <i>and </i>free purple pentapus healing baths—simply out of the goodness of his heart, of course—or even a potential hideout.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Possible Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The members of the Yu Dao Bounty Hunters Guild just so hap- pen to be relaxing in one of the many spa rooms after a long day of hunting down the PCs! They see the companions and attack!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Flameo Hot Springs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Located directly across the river from the Eel-Swan Sauna, the Flameo Hot Springs is a simple but very trendy spa of heated pools alongside river views and a plant-based restaurant of bite- size servings and lychee nut tea. The singsong voice, easy laugh, and attentive, down-to-earth customer service of the owner, Shuryon, delight her guests. When she meets the PCs, she tells them that there’s only one room left at Flameo Hot Springs that she sensed she had to keep vacant, and she’s even turned some guests away to the lovely gentleman at the Eel-Swan Sauna.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Could the companions be the pilgrims she sensed that need her so direly? The Flameo Hot Springs owner welcomes the PCs as her personal guests if they accept the invitation. Of course, in re- ality, she knows they’re hiding something and would love to find out what. If nothing else, she’d like to know the specifics of any suspicious details of their travel, including how they obtained a Sparrowkeet dirigible…</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Possible Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flameo’s owner eavesdrops on the companions’ conversations and calls the bounty hunters she sent away who are relaxing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at Eel-Swan Sauna. Flameo Hot Springs seems successful, but starting the business has put Shuryon in massive debt; the boun- ty on Qian Yu’s head is just what the owner needs to keep afloat. The bounty hunters attack!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nearly everything in the Iron Tavern is metal. The walls, the floor, the furniture…If people could eat metal, the food would be metal too. Even the performers play metal. The Iron Tavern boasts Yu Dao pride in its masterful metalworking, and it boasts it loudly because all the metal-on-metal surfaces clink and clank with a robust fervor. The Iron Tavern also hosts inn guests up- stairs but fair warning: the beds are metal too. The Iron Tavern is a popular hangout for members of the Yu Dao Bounty Hunters Guild, and the tavern goers love a good fight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The metal tavern is run by a Firebender/Earthbender couple named Yoko and Bin. Not too long ago their two sons, Flint and Ember (see “Important Characters”), ran away from home and the owners are worried sick. They offered members of the Yu Dao Bounty Hunter Guild free drinks for life if they could find their sons…but so far the bounty hunters have only taken the drinks and not done much else to help the worried couple.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Possible Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Snow Rats arrive in the Iron Tavern with a bounty flyer of Qian Yu. The members of the Yu Dao Bounty Hunters Guild notice and take issue with someone else going after their bounty. There are simply too many bounty hunters in the tavern and if no one helps the Snow Rats they’re pummeled into submission and any money they’ve saved to bring back to their families</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is “confiscated for damages.” <b>Mechanically here, treat the Bounty Hunters as a Master-level threat </b>with 10-fatigue, five conditions, and a 0 to +3 balance track to indicate how many there are, and how they can overwhelm the Snow Rats.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Yu Dao</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The first Fire Nation colony of their invasion of the Earth Kingdom, Yu Dao has since transformed into a new place with its own distinctive culture and identity. Modern Yu Dao draws from both Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation traditions, with many families within the city descending from a union between mem- bers of both nations. The city is still renowned for its metalwork, and that means that Sparrowkeet Air has their own facility and presence within the greater city. Going straight into Yu Dao can be fraught for the PCs as a result—Sparrowkeet guards don’t have impunity to act within Yu Dao without restraint, but they have notice about Qian Yu and likely the heroes themselves by the time they reach Yu Dao.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As such, the PCs are likely to want to bypass as much of Yu Dao as they can to go directly to the Beifong Metalbending Academy in the nearby mountains. Depending upon the exact situation, it might be a bit uncertain if the PCs can successfully make the trip—they might have to dodge some Sparrowkeet pursuers on their way to the mountains—or they might be able to skirt the edge of the city and go directly to the staircase up to the Academy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about Yu Dao in the core book in “The Hundred Year War Era” in <b>Chapter 2: The World of Avatar</b>.</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The path to Yu Dao and the Beifong Metalbending Academy isn’t perfectly straightforward, not least be- cause the PCs are being pursued by an airship! They might want to go different, unexpected ways just to throw off pursuers. The pursuers themselves can all catch up to the PCs at different places, as well—the suggested escalations indicate which pursuers might make good antagonists at particular times, but all the pursuers are always in play!</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The key is that every path always ends at Yu Dao and the Beifong Metalbending Academy. One way or another, that’s where the PCs are headed, and that’s where any major conflicts are likely to come to a head with an explosive finale. After all, any antago- nists can likely figure out where the PCs are headed after a bit, and might be waiting there for them!</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Beifong Metalbending Academy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A long staircase climbs up towards the original Beifong Metal- bending Academy, built on a mountain peak north of Yu Dao. A central courtyard is surrounded on three sides by the original academy and two newer large buildings. Towers peek out from the mountain’s greenery. If the PCs arrive during the day, the courtyard is full of uniformed students practicing traditional</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">earthbending stances and metalbending. If the PCs arrive during the evening, a single shy student practices lavabending, which glows in the dark of night, and can fetch their instructor. Toph Beifong is not present, having been called away on an important mission—something that happens with regularity. Believing Sparrowkeet Air wouldn’t dare accost the academy, Qian Yu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is content to wait for Toph’s return under the protection of the Metalbenders. (Note: If a PC is an Earthbender for whom learning to metalbend or lavabend is a part of their character’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">story, here is an opportunity for them to learn that skill or make connections to learn it in the future. See the core book, page 216, for more on how to learn to metalbend or lavabend.)</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Possible Escalation</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sparrowkeet Air decides to make a last ditch attempt to secure the artifact, but likely not via direct confrontation. Attacking the Academy outright—especially in a dirigible made of metal—is asking to get trounced. Instead, they would likely send in Captain Biho and some guards on a covert mission, requiring the PCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to muster one last quiet and careful defense of Qian Yu and the artifact before Toph returns. Only use this escalation if you are in need of one final confrontation to cap off the story—in general, the Beifong Metalbending Academy is the destination of the entire journey the heroes are on, and attacking would require one of the Yuzhens to be willing to make a powerful enemy. If Yuzhen Sr. or Yuzhen Jr. have been unbalanced over the course of the adventure, though, they might think the attack is worth it...</p>
