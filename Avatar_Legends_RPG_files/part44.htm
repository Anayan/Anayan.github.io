<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part18.htm#bookmark59" class="s25">The Air Nation is revitalized now that there are more Airbend- ers in the world again. Thanks to the work of Avatar Aang and his allies, the Nomad temples are now fully restored (save the Northern Air Temple; see page 26)</a> and Acolytes preserve the ways of the Nomads for generations to come. The Air Nation now strives to help bring balance to the world as their predeces- sors did before the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The culture might not be the same as it once was, but this group of Airbenders and Air Acolytes work together to form a new cultural identity informed by, but not the same as, its past. For quite some time, Avatar Aang’s son, Tenzin, and his three eldest children were the only Airbenders in the world with the excep- tion of Korra. After Harmonic Convergence, many non-benders suddenly gained airbending abilities. Now, the Air Nation is made up of Acolytes and Airbenders from each of the other nations. The sky bison population even bounced back.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark82" class="s25">The Nomads recently took on the responsibility of caring for the Republic City spirit portal. Relations between spirits and humans have been rough since the spirit portals re-opened, but the Airbenders and Acolytes work hard to help keep balance between the physical world and the Spirit World. It’s a natural role for them to take, as the Air Nomads communed with spirits for thousands of years before the genocide (page 58).</a>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tenzin</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An airbending master raising a family of Airbenders in a dangerous world</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Tenzin is Avatar Aang and Katara’s son. He has spent his life</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">keeping the practice of airbending and Air Nomad culture alive. His wife, Pema, is an Air Acolyte, and three of his children— Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo—are Airbenders while the fourth, Ro- han, is still a toddler whose bending abilities may not have mani- fested yet. Some consider Tenzin to be uptight and strict, but his behavior is born out of a deep desire to uphold his father’s legacy and ensure a decent future for his family and the Air Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Tenzin was also Avatar Korra’s airbending teacher. The two have not always seen eye to eye and both Tenzin and Korra can be stubborn, which causes friction between the two. However, Tenzin’s years and experience have taught him patience—a trait that often mends any disagreements the two may have. The rela- tionship Tenzin and Korra share is special, a friendship forged in forgiveness and acceptance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">He has tried to pass on his spirituality to his children, and Jinora has taken a special interest in the spiritual matters of Air Nomad culture. Heroes who want to pursue a spiritual quest might come to Tenzin for advice. Likewise, anyone fighting to protect the Air Nation and its history has an ally in Tenzin.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jinora</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An airbending master with a knack for understanding spirits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jinora is an extremely skilled Airbender and a master at navigat- ing the Spirit World, communicating with spirits and befriend- ing them. She is particularly adept at spirit projection and locat- ing people and things while her consciousness is outside of her body. When her father couldn’t help the Avatar enter the Spirit World, it was Jinora who proved capable and did so instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Soon after, Jinora was anointed an airbending master and given her arrow tattoos, the mark of a master Airbender. It’s a distinc- tion she shares only with her father and Korra.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the oldest of her siblings, Jinora can occasionally get frustrated when the others distract her, complain, or question her decisions. She is greatly respected by the other members of the Air Nation and has taught airbending since she was very young. Any- one having difficulty with spirits or wanting to develop their spiri- tual abilities could find no one better to help them than Jinora.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bumi</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A clever military commander who recently developed airbending abilities</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Bumi is the eldest of Avatar Aang and Katara’s three children,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and up until a few years ago, he was a non-bender. As the Com- mander of the Second Division of the United Forces, Bumi was a skilled leader, daring almost to the point of recklessness. He has a knack for spotting advantageous tactical opportunities even in the most dire of circumstances. The recent Harmonic Conver- gence threw a new challenge Bumi’s way when he developed airbending skills. He had to learn how to use these abilities from scratch and is still working on mastering them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Bumi tends to tell elaborate and dramatic stories that most people believe are greatly embellished. Though he occasionally acts out in immature ways, Bumi would do anything for his family and doesn’t run away from difficult situations. Those who aspire to become world-class military strategists could learn a lot from him, as he is well-respected by his peers and superiors alike in the United Forces. Just don’t expect a conventional education.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New Airbenders</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Individuals who developed airbending after Harmonic Convergence <a href="part42.htm#bookmark100" class="s25">The Air Nation now includes a growing number of Airbenders who come from all over the world, such as Suyin Beifong’s (page </a>
<span class="p">86) daughter Opal and a former thief named Kai who were</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">both born in the Earth Kingdom. These new Airbenders were so valuable that Earth Queen Hou-Ting had many abducted and forced them to join her army. Avatar Korra, Tenzin, and Bumi rescued the Airbenders from the queen and gave them the op- tion to either go their own ways or train under Tenzin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Most Airbenders have a few years of training under their belt, but not all people with airbending talents joined the Air Na- tion—some are still out there, reluctant to leave their loved ones behind. Airbenders who choose to train with Tenzin continue the tradition of travelling and aiding the Avatar. Now the new Airbenders can be found all over the globe. Some live a nomadic lifestyle and travel from place to place looking to be of service, while others care for the Air Temples, and still others haven’t yet joined the Air Nation as a whole.</p>

<a href="part39.htm#bookmark96" class="s25">Ghazan (page 80)</a> used his lavabending to tear the temple</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">down, leaving only ruins. Any history it held is lost, save for what lives on in the surviving Air Nomads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Some of the Air Nation may wish to find a place to fill the gap that this temple has left, and there may even be those who hold out hope of somehow rebuilding the temple. However, if the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Air Nation were to rebuild the temple, they’d need substantial assistance and resources to do so. Then, there is the question as to what form will the temple take? And will it be a bastion of Nomad history or a modernized temple of a new era? Without</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">someone willing to take on this monumental task, the Northern Air Temple remains lost for now.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reluctant Airbenders</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: The Duties of Leadership</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plenty of people developed airbending abilities after Harmon- ic Convergence but decided not to train at the Northern Air Temple with the others. Some of them may still struggle with these new abilities, and some may have decided to put them to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nefarious uses. Airbending is a difficult art to master, and a bend- er may never reach their full potential without guidance.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Those who come to the Air Nomads now might have spent time using incorrect techniques that are hard to correct now that they’ve become habits. Retraining them will be difficult both</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for the students and for their teachers. The effort is worth it, though—Air Nomads are needed now more than ever. Not only to work with the growing number of spirits, but to be a force of balance in the world.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Portal Caretakers</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked themes: Setting Boundaries</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Nomads are now caretakers of the spirit portal in Re- public City, along with the lands that surround them. Not only must the Nomads contend with people looking to exploit the portal for personal gain, but they must work with the spirits who wish to live in the mortal world. This is no easy task, especially for a nation as small as the Air Nomads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The push and pull between spirits and humans can be hard to navigate. This is exemplified in Republic City, where the spirits have taken over large portions of the city and the human inhabitants struggle with their new neighbors. Many spirits feel humans must simply accept their presence, but it’s a hard matter to contend with as humans often see themselves as the center of the world. Unresolved issues with living alongside one another mean humans and spirits could fight, an event the Air Nomads work tirelessly to prevent.</p>
