<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rangi gives the heroes a directive at the start of this adventure: find the children, and keep the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se stable. The details of how to accomplish this goal are open-ended, with several routes to success. The characters are free to move around the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se as they wish, and they have Meng- yao as a touchstone for getting started. There’s quite a lot going on, and the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se is a huge area. The players may find investigating and moving around such an area daunting. Here are a few tips to help ensure the adventure goes smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Getting Around Town</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se is huge, and even though this adventure will keep the characters within the Lower Ring, they still have a lot of ground to cover. Most travel in Ba Sing Se will have to be on foot. While there are handcarts and wagons the characters could rent to go longer distances, they will mostly be walking everywhere they go.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The streets of the Lower Ring are dangerous in the best of times, with small gangs looking for easy marks and regular</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disputes over territories. During this adventure, that danger is doubled. The guards are on edge. They will shake down anyone who looks unfamiliar, especially if that person looks like they could be a Fire Nation citizen. The guards are also hyper-focused on finding <i>daofei</i>, and Mengyao in particular. The heroes’ associ- ation with the <i>daofei </i>means that they need to be careful around the Earth Kingdom guards.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Even if they aren’t being directly targeted, the characters may find the city streets blocked by fighting among any of the oppos- ing groups in this adventure. Task force members might try to pick fights with Firebenders, <i>daofei</i>, or even just normal citizens who look suspicious.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As the GM, you can easily present all of this tension and danger in the form of scenes and incidents that the PCs come across as they move through the city, without those scenes ever targeting the PCs themselves. Task force members embroiled in a fight with <i>daofei </i>might not pay any attention to the PCs at first. The heroes then have to decide what to do in the face of such a situation, especially if the fight is threatening the surroundings and other innocent citizens of Ba Sing Se. Any responses have their own uncertainty and will lead to interesting scenes! What’s more, you can also use other GM moves to help bring home the consequences of those scenes. Avoiding the fight by sneaking through might help the PCs dodge fatigue or conditions...but their balance might shift to represent how their actions truly reflect on their principles!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Be careful about getting too hung up on these scenes, howev- er. If the PCs get derailed from their overall pursuits too often by these chance encounters, they might get frustrated in an un-fun way. Try to make these incidents connected to the core conflicts of this scenario where possible. For example, the PCs’ mistreat- ment of <i>daofei </i>might make things harder for them when Hana, Lei Fang, or even Mengyao hear about those incidents. And a “random group of guards” might always be working directly for Yong, or might even be Hana’s <i>daofei </i>in stolen uniforms!</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Making Daofei</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The action in this adventure centers on the Fanged Mercenaries, but other <i>daofei </i>are involved in the Lower Ring’s greater issues. The task force is targeting any and all “criminals,” and those targets are fed up with the treatment and are striking back.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">You may want to include another gang or individual <i>daofei </i>as antagonists, or as unlikely allies for the heroes to interact with. When making the character, consider that they aren’t all just mindless brutes. Most people join the ranks of the <i>daofei </i>as a way to survive in a world that doesn’t seem to care about them. They call those who follow the government “abiders” and vow not to work with law enforcement of any kind. But that doesn’t mean they are all villains. Many <i>daofei </i>simply work outside the law to accomplish their goals, not caring to pay outrageous fees or follow restrictive measures. Some are actively good people, trying to ensure the most underprivileged people get access to goods and services when needed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Within this adventure, try to only make individual <i>daofei</i>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">minor NPCs, and try to only make groups of <i>daofei </i>the equiv- alent of major NPCs. This adventure has plenty of significant opposition throughout, and making additional <i>daofei </i>dangerous opponents can inadvertently draw focus from the core conflicts of this adventure. If those characters return to your game, you can always reinvent them as major or even master NPCs later as needed. You can find more on making NPCs on page 234 of the core book, and see a few sample NPCs in <b>Appendix B: NPCs </b>of the core book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When creating <i>daofei</i>, decide their motivations for turning to a criminal life, and allow that to dictate the kinds of actions they take, what they are willing to risk, and who they are willing to cross to achieve their goals. This won’t mean every <i>daofei </i>secretly has a heart of gold and will ally with the PCs; it means instead that the <i>daofei </i>are complicated characters, like any you’d</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">encounter in the Avatarverse. Some <i>daofei </i>won’t care at all about the PCs’ mission until they understand that the PCs are trying to rescue children, and then they will step in. Other <i>daofei </i>are far more concerned about the overbearing task force and the Fire Nation contingent than the kidnapping itself, and they won’t even consider helping the PCs until those forces stand down or depart the Lower Ring.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Setting up more of these <i>daofei </i>characters is most vitally important when you are using this adventure within an ongoing campaign. While the nature of this adventure is by and large fairly directed and specific—save the children from their kidnap- pers and clear Mengyao’s name—it also works as an overview of a much larger conflict that runs throughout all of Ba Sing Se and even the Earth Kingdom as a whole. If you are going to pick up the campaign beyond this single adventure, then these addi- tional <i>daofei </i>give the PCs more contacts in the city, more foes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to oppose, and more allies to either aid or ask for aid. Learning more about the disparate perspectives also builds up Ba Sing Se as a rich and fruitful setting for further stories!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Escalations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The heroes can deal with the situation in any way they choose. They may decide they don’t care to find the children, or that they don’t want to take down Lei Fang’s Mercenaries. No matter what they decide, the action shouldn’t stop. Use escalations to add conflict when the players run out of ideas or the action falters, or to reveal new information and add action to a scene. Some esca- lations will provide new information that may make the players question their actions, and other escalations can purely be an opportunity for action. Here are some examples you can use:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A fight breaks out between patrons of Lowtown Laundry and the Fire Nation soldiers quartered there, leading the proprietor, Hop, to angrily demand Tan and the Firebenders leave. Tan tries to negotiate with them, but Yong arrives</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on the scene with forces from the anti-corruption task force and he takes the opportunity to evict the Firebenders from the Lower Ring for disturbing the peace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The anti-corruption task force arrests an innocent citizen simply for being the sibling of a <i>daofei</i>. In response, Lower Ring citizens start a riot. Fed up with guards and soldiers disrupting their daily life, they move to the task force offices in the Lower Ring to demand satisfaction and the release of the innocent citizen. The task force guards respond in force. If no one quells the riot, the guards eventually do so on their own, but not before seriously injuring several citizens.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A warning shot from one of Tan’s Firebenders goes awry, causing a fire in the Wood Frog Lumberyard. <i>Daofei </i>members who are hiding there think they are under attack. Some respond against the Firebenders with force; others scramble to put the fire out before the guards arrive and find their main hideout.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The anti-corruption task force has come too close to finding the Mercenaries’ hideout where Hana and Lei Fang are keeping the children. While Mercenaries attack the task force, Lei Fang moves the children just in case, shifting them to another hideout that will ultimately keep them out of reach of the heroes. But while moving the children, Lei Fang is in the open and visible, carrying one child under each arm…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• Hana decides she’s done waiting for the Earth Kingdom to arrest Mengyao and wants to up the stakes. She takes a small contingent of the gang who are loyal to her to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">negotiate with Tan and the Firebenders, offering to return the children if the Firebenders destroy Mengyao. Tan agrees, although he is more than willing to betray the deal to rescue the children. Lei Fang, who never wanted to hurt the children and doesn’t agree with this plan, seeks aid from someone who might be able to stop Hana from escalating the situation—perhaps even Mengyao herself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Word gets out that Rangi has departed to find Avatar Kyoshi, and now Hana and Lei Fang fear the Avatar’s impending arrival—everyone knows that Kyoshi is merciless! They send the Fanged Mercenaries to cause havoc and draw out Mengyao in hopes that they can quickly capture her and then turn her over to the task force or to Kyoshi quickly, absolving themselves and maybe even collecting a reward!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Dealing with Bystanders</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ba Sing Se is the most populous city in the Earth Kingdom, and the Lower Ring is filled with people. The vast majority of the in- habitants of the Lower Ring are simply Earth Kingdom citizens trying to go about their lives. They are not involved with any <i>daofei </i>gangs, and many wouldn’t even know if they bumped into a <i>daofei </i>on the street. Any time a fight breaks out in the street, there are bound to be innocent bystanders who are just trying to go about their days.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember that when action happens, uninvolved people are likely to be around—any of whom could get hurt, displaced, or arrested by guards. The PCs may be very concerned with ensuring bystander safety, and there’s plenty of opportunity for them to remove people from dangerous situations, quell fights,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">or redirect task force scrutiny to help these people. Be sure to let the players know when the action they are involved in is happen- ing in a crowded area, or when passersby might get hurt.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Use a threat against innocent bystanders as a GM move, demanding PC action. The PCs are heroes, after all—they likely won’t just leave people to a terrible fate when they can help! If the PCs are considering chasing some enemy instead of helping, then consider <span class="s11">calling on them to live up to their principle </span>or shift- ing their balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs do help innocent bystanders, they can provide tips, shortcuts, and other help—even if they only give the PCs a good meal and a moment to catch their breath (clearing a condition or a couple fatigue), then it’s likely to make the players feel that their heroism was recognized!</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Role of Rangi and the Avatar <span class="p">Rangi asked the PCs to find the children and help keep the Lower Ring stable while she goes to get Kyoshi’s help. That can suggest a particular outcome to the overall story—that Rangi</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and Kyoshi return and magically solve every problem with their awesomeness. After all, Kyoshi is the Avatar!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Within your own game, however, Kyoshi and Rangi shouldn’t be a cure-all by any means. If the PCs don’t take action, then by the time Kyoshi and Rangi return and are able to help, the situ- ation will already have fallen apart entirely. The heroes are the only hope for anyone to resolve the current situation peaceably and without undue anguish; the fact that Kyoshi is on her way doesn’t change that!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rangi and Kyoshi won’t show up at the end of the adventure to instantly save the day and rescue the heroes. At best, Kyoshi gets hung up with problems throughout the Lower Ring and even with the Earth King and his guards, while Rangi can return in time to help with the final action, perhaps keeping some larger group of foes occupied so the PCs can focus on their primary opposition. At worst, they both show up after the action is already resolved, helping with clean-up but unable to tip the balance of a fight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If Rangi does show up in time for the final fight, feel free to not have Rangi participate in actual combat exchanges. If she did, then the GM would have to make her attacks against other NPCs—it’s not impossible using the tools of combat exchanges, but inherently when one NPC acts against another, there is no uncertainty. The GM just says what happens! As such, make</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">moves that honor Rangi’s role at the end of the conflict while keeping her out of the direct spotlight. She can absolutely keep a whole group of task force members or <i>daofei </i>occupied while the PCs focus on another group; she can help deal with a fire or an- other catastrophe; but she should not simply solve the problem and defeat the antagonists of the adventure, leaving the PCs to twiddle their thumbs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing a one-shot, a short interaction with Rangi and Kyoshi in which the two legendary characters respect the compan- ions’ sacrifices and commitment to doing the right thing can be a great cap on the whole adventure. It gives a chance to truly make the PCs feel special, like their actions had a real effect on the world since they’ve been recognized by Rangi and Kyoshi.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing this adventure as part of a larger campaign, then you can easily pick up with the consequences of the adventure. Kyoshi and Rangi are in town, but there are plenty of problems left to resolve even after the kidnapping. The Fire Nation delegation may have taken unacceptable actions, the</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">daofei <span class="p">may still be prominent and active, and the Earth King may have strong opinions on the Avatar’s interference.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In that case, this is a perfect time for one or more PCs to learn a few lessons and techniques from Rangi and Kyoshi! The two</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of them likely are impressed with the PCs and even in their debt a bit, and while they have plenty to do, they might be willing to share some of their hard-won lessons with the PCs. A mastery condition for a technique they teach a hero might tie back into the problems they have to attend to in Ba Sing Se.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Proving Mengyao’s Innocence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao is being framed by Lei Fang and Hana for the abduc- tion of Ambassador Quin’s children. At the end of the adventure, it’s possible that Quin, Yong, and Tan all still believe that Meng- yao was the actual abductor, and it will be down to the PCs to prove Mengyao’s innocence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If Hana and Lei Fang are willing to confess to what they have done, then the issue can be resolved quickly and painlessly. Yong will have a culprit to imprison, and Tan and Quin can see justice being done. Convincing either Hana or Lei Fang to come clean is no easy feat, although Lei Fang is a more likely confessor than Hana. But in both cases, if the PCs cause the NPCs to lose their balance, that stands the best chance of leading them to a full change of how they see things and think of themselves, in turn leading to a change of heart and a willingness to confess. Using moves like <span class="s11">plead</span>, <span class="s11">intimidate</span>, or <span class="s11">trick </span>are a lot less likely to gener- ate a usable confession—Hana and Lei Fang are a lot less likely to care what the PCs actually have to say; they’re a lot less likely to give into intimidation; and any kind of deception in soliciting a confession won’t actually satisfy Quin, Yong, or Tan.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The PCs can also try to find proof of Mengyao’s innocence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and Hana and Lei Fang’s guilt. Depending upon exactly how they seek this evidence, <span class="s11">relying on skills and training </span>can be a useful tool for the PCs. But in general, Hana and Lei Fang hav- en’t left some kind of paper trail that easily traces back to them. They’re experienced and capable <i>daofei </i>who didn’t embark on this endeavor foolishly; finding any kind of definitive evidence isn’t especially likely in and of itself. If something reasonable makes sense, fantastic! But don’t make sure to provide a smoking gun, as it were, just so the PCs can prove Mengyao’s innocence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">A likely outcome, then, is that the PCs fully believe in Mengyao’s innocence, but they don’t have any hard evidence. They don’t have a confession, they don’t have proof...all they have is their own belief and any evidence of Mengyao’s deeds helping them or rescuing the children. In this case, the PCs have to convince at least one, and likely two, of Quin, Yong, and Tan in order to resolve the issue of Mengyao’s guilt. Those NPCs are far more likely to be receptive of <span class="s11">pleading</span>, <span class="s11">intimidation</span>, or even <span class="s11">tricking</span>, though all of those carry their own risks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Be sure to take into account the PCs’ deeds when considering how the NPCs react to a plea from the heroes about Mengyao’s innocence. If the PCs rescued the children, captured Hana and Lei Fang, and kept any of the conflict from significantly damag- ing the Lower Ring, then their sheer success and accomplish- ments speak enormously well of them. Quin alone might trust their word instantly, and Tan will likely already come to their side easily. If the PCs instead weren’t directly responsible for rescuing the children, failed to capture Hana and Lei Fang, and allowed the Lower Ring to suffer a massive fire...all three, Yong especially, will be much more skeptical.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Rangi can help a great deal with this final attempt to prove</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao’s innocence. If the PCs can convince Rangi of Meng- yao’s innocence in a similar way, then Rangi can convince at least one of the three other NPCs, in turn.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Hana vs. Lei Fang</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Hana and Lei Fang are allies, together the leaders of the Fanged Mercenaries, they aren’t perfectly in sync. Hana is more ruthless and direct in her desire to acquire power, and her end goal is to become powerful at the level of the Earth Kingdom as a whole. Lei Fang, on the other hand, is primarily trying to gain power over the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se, and he has more lines that he will not cross—if nothing else, Lei Fang doesn’t want to harm the kidnapped children at all, while Hana would consider doing so if the situation called for it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">It’s possible that the PCs come to see the divide between Hana and Lei Fang, and can target that rift. If they can drive a wedge between the two, they might be able to significantly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reduce their opposition, and even entice a confession out of one of them. They might even be able to convince one of them to mend their ways.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs never encounter Hana or Lei Fang until the very end of the adventure, however, then they won’t have much of a chance to see that there is a rift, let alone drive a wedge between them. Make sure that as the GM, you represent this rift through- out the game. If the PCs encounter Hana and Lei Fang as they move through the Lower Ring—for example, if the two <i>daofei </i>meet the heroes to offer a deal—then the PCs can pick up on the tension between them. Make softer GM moves that indi- cate a growing rift—focus on sideways glances, uncomfortable coughing, fidgeting, signs that as one of them speaks, the other is stifling disagreement. If the PCs do make moves that might reveal more information, point at these moments of tension.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">But most of the basic moves can’t easily get the two leaders to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">turn against each other. They have a strong bond, and only the greatest of tension will actually successfully come between them. To represent this, focus on their balance tracks and their condi- tions. If they lose their balance, then they arrive at a place of real vulnerability about their beliefs; it’s a chance for them to break with one another. If either one of them loses their balance while the PCs are present and ready to push them apart, then look to the NPC’s conditions; if they have more than half of their con- ditions marked, then either Hana or Lei Fang will likely break with the other leader.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In all cases, however, use your best judgment and adhere to your agendas, baselines, guidelines, and moves. That means</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that sometimes an appropriate hard move—even on a miss!— might be the moment that the rift between Lei Fang and Hana explodes into an actual fight, threatening all the local area. Use the division as a dramatic element to complicate the story and avoid simplistic resolutions in which the leaders of the Fanged Mercenaries are simple, moustache-twirling villains.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Note also that Hana is a Master NPC, while Lei Fang is a Ma- jor NPC. This is because in general, Hana is a more dangerous individual than Lei Fang, and much more likely to be a signifi- cant source of direct opposition than Lei Fang, especially at the end of the story.</p>
