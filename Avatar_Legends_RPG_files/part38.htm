</p>
<p class="s45" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Aang Era</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Hundred Year War is over, Zuko is now Fire Lord, and the Fire Nation must now contend with its bloody history of imperi- alism. Since his tumultuous ascension to the throne, Zuko faces constant attacks by those who want his imprisoned father reinstat- ed. While Ozai remains in prison, stripped of his bending, Zuko’s sister Azula is still at large. Despite these challenges, the new Fire Lord and his allies are set on steering the Fire Nation away from its imperialist history and towards a world united in harmony.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">It is a strange time to be a Fire Nation citizen or colonist. Much of the world still resents the Fire Nation because of the grievous harm its government and military inflicted, and many do not know how to feel about its civilians. After all, many will- ingly supported Fire Lord Ozai’s regime or allied with it in fear of punishment. For the first time in a century, the people of the Fire Nation must learn what it means to be part of the world and not just a part of the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">To that end many Fire Nation citizens work where they can to repair some of the damage inflicted by the war. As a result of Zuko’s reforms, scholars strive to recover lost history and elimi-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nate deceitful propaganda long taught in school texts; Fire Nation inventors contact Earth Kingdom colleagues to collaborate for the first time in over a century; and the Fire Nation now crafts policy to ensure nothing like the Hundred Year War ever happens again.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Zuko</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new Fire Lord who works with the Avatar to restore balance <span class="p">Zuko is the first Fire Lord in generations to look beyond an impe- rialist agenda for the Fire Nation. Trying to do things differently and turn back decades of wrongdoing is no small task. Between upsetting people with the attempted Harmony Restoration Move- ment, fending off assassination attempts, and contending with his sister Azula’s machinations, Zuko has a lot on his hands.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Some citizens of the Fire Nation don’t believe what is best for the rest of the world is what is best for them, and that makes Zuko feel like he must choose between them and diplomatic relations. Though he may doubt himself sometimes, it is clear to his closest friends, like Avatar Aang, that he will have a tremen- dous influence on the world for the better. Heroes hoping to improve diplomatic relations between nations might serve the Fire Lord directly, try to protect his life against threats, or work with him on restoration projects.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uncle Iroh</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A wise and compassionate mentor still providing guidance in retirement <span class="p">Iroh, no longer the war-focused “Dragon of the West” as in his youth, now finds joy in the small things in life—like tea—and the company of others. He is one of the Avatar’s wisest and most com- passionate allies and helps anyone fighting for harmony and jus- tice. The Fire Lord is like another son to him, and Iroh has stood by Zuko through thick and thin. Though he mostly spends his days running his tea shop, the Jasmine Dragon in Ba Sing Se, he still aids Zuko and the Avatar whenever he can, even stepping in as interim Fire Lord when Zuko needs to attend to personal matters. Additionally, he still serves as a Grand Lotus in the Order of the White Lotus. Those looking to join the White Lotus in order to help bring peace to the world would be wise to seek him out.</span>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Azula</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The dangerous Fire Princess at her wits’ end</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark90" class="s25">After failing to defeat the Avatar and his allies with her father, Azula was institutionalized rather than imprisoned, as the fight pushed the princess to her breaking point. Zuko then withdrew Azula from the institution to help search for their missing moth- er Ursa, but Azula used the mission as a chance to try to kill her instead. After that, she disguised herself as a dark spirit, in order to manipulate the New Ozai Society (page 70)</a> into attacking Zuko…to make him strong, or so she claims.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Despite everything that has happened Azula may very well care for the welfare of her brother…though their relationship remains tenuous. Azula still has the remaining Fire Warriors at her disposal, but she could choose to strike out on her own</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">instead. Chances are she isn’t far from Zuko, and she is unlikely to be willingly taken alive.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nergüi</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A skilled assassin working to mend past misdeeds</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the war Nergüi only ever acted with the belief that the Fire Nation brought prosperity to the world, even as he took on heinous missions for his home nation. Every horrible thing he’d done was put into question when Ozai was defeated, and the extent of his genocidal plans became apparent. For the first time in his life, Nergüi suffered a crisis of faith. After a year of despair, Nergüi swore to dedicate his remaining years to undoing the wrong he inflicted on the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To that end, Nergüi still works as a spy…but for the new government. He specializes in hunting down the worst offenders of the Hundred Year War and bringing them in to stand trial for their crimes. Nergüi is still learning what it means to be on the right side of things and while his espionage skills may be un- paralleled, he always benefits from people who provide a moral compass on his missions.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fire Warriors</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Azula’s mysterious group of warriors plotting their next move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Warriors are a group led by Azula who impersonated dark spirits, Kemurikage, to manipulate the New Ozai Society. The group was comprised of women Azula broke out of mental health institutions, as Azula herself was in a similar facility after Zuko and Katara defeated her at the end of the Hundred Year War. The Fire Warriors went so far as to abduct children to make themselves more believable as local dark spirits, but Avatar Aang, Zuko, Mai, and the Kyoshi Warriors rescued them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Though many of the Fire Warriors were captured, Azula and a handful of others managed to get away. With their numbers reduced—and Azula not necessarily standing by the group she founded—the Fire Warriors are wantonly reckless with their plans. They might target heroes who help Zuko or find ways to turn other citizens against their Fire Lord.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Satoru</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A young industrialist chasing after the future in order to escape his past <span class="p">Satoru is a young Fire Nation citizen who works in the Earthen Fire Refinery. He was first employed there by his uncle Loban, but has found more freedom since Loban joined the Air Aco- lytes. He now works alongside Lao Beifong to help Cranefish Town prosper. If there are strange goings-on in Cranefish Town, Satoru knows about them.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part37.htm#bookmark93" class="s25">Satoru had a crush on Toph for a while (page 74)</a> and worships her as a hero of the Hundred Year War. Though not a bender himself, he is in awe of Toph’s bending abilities and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aspires to accomplish things with technology that formerly only benders could do. He is passionate about innovation and helping his employees and the people of Cranefish Town.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Repairing Damage and Investigating War Crimes</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Healing Deep Wounds</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation’s military grievously harmed the other nations under Ozai’s rule, and not everyone is willing to trust Fire Na- tion citizens. In some parts of the world, Fire Nation citizens are used to walking freely and openly, the advantage of being on the side of successful conquerors; now no longer a privileged class, they are treated as ordinary people or outcasts. In other parts of the world, people aren’t used to seeing Fire Nation citizens at all without accompanying soldiers and officers of the Fire Army.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Few understand this conundrum as deeply as the scholars and investigators responsible for documenting the Fire Nation’s war crimes in an attempt to formulate appropriate reparations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Investigators’ jobs are difficult in that they must investigate crimes that took place all throughout the war, often with little to no recorded evidence save for numerous first-person accounts. No matter what investigators conclude, their reports are highly contested for being biased one way or another. Heroes who want to help the Fire Nation with reparations could aid investigators in compiling evidence and hunting down war criminals still at large.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uncertain Loyalties</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Growing Pains</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While some officials openly criticize Fire Lord Zuko, others hold their tongues while secretly plotting to get rid of him. These plots aren’t solely focused on the Fire Lord himself—they may include his entire cabinet of advisors. Government officials who came to power after Ozai was ousted fight against a century of hate for a peaceful future. They work openly and honestly with the Fire Lord, engaging in hours of discussion and debate of what the future of the Fire Nation should be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Hiding amongst these officials are politicians who outwardly agree with the Fire Lord’s plans, but secretly conspire against him. They also work against their colleagues, stir up hate, and try to swiftly thwart any plan towards progress. If heroes could find a way to uncover these traitors, it would go a long way towards reforming the Fire Nation’s political system.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lingering Prejudice</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Coexistence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation works to establish peaceful relations with the other nations, but it’s hard to shrug off a century’s worth of pro- paganda. Some citizens and former officials alike still believe the rest of the world would be better off under Fire Nation rule. When foreigners visit the Fire Nation, they might run into prejudiced individuals who don’t want them there and business owners who don’t want to offer their services. Similarly, when Fire Nation citizens visit other nations for the first time, they may be surprised to find that these places are not like how they were depicted in propaganda. Heroes from other nations who don’t want to stand out may have a difficult time if they run into those holding onto wartime prejudices. Antagonistic groups like the Fire Warriors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">or New Ozai Society may take advantage of people’s prejudice in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">order to gain extra resources or thwart opposition.</p>
