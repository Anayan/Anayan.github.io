<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The adventure starts the companions right in the middle of this messy conflict. Ambassador Quin’s children have been missing for a few days. The PCs are all connected to Mengyao—they helped Mengyao turn over a new leaf and become a vigilante protecting innocents from more dangerous <i>daofei</i>—and should be interested in either clearing her name and identifying the real perpetrators or finding out why she turned back to more disreputable ways. All of that makes a lot of assumptions about the characters and their connections to the major players in this scenario.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">To start the game, the characters need connections to Ba Sing Se, Rangi, and Mengyao. <span class="p">Before the game starts, use the following questions to help the players establish their characters in Ba Sing Se and connections to Rangi.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Why are you in Ba Sing Se? (Ignore this question if players are in Ba Sing Se already, using the pregenerated characters, or if they set their inciting incident around this adventure.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The characters as a group witnessed an important event involving Rangi in the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. What was it, and who else was involved?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• During this event, the characters as a group impressed Rangi with their skills. What did they do?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Rangi trusts the group to find the children and keep the situation peaceful. Why does she believe in them?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then have each player fill in information about how the group previously engaged with Mengyao and helped her turn over a new leaf. <span class="p">The key is that every player gets a chance to give input into the group’s shared history with Mengyao, along with defining her personality traits. Players can decide if Mengyao is kind and caring, or cold and distant. Whatever traits the players decide on should build upon one another and make a well-rounded, if com- plex, individual. Make sure to build the answers to the questions into a coherent story, and if desired, the GM can shift PC’s balance based on the answers to these questions using the rules for </span>flash- backs <span class="p">from the core book on page 262.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• We befriended Mengyao when we helped her get out of a jam. What had she done, who caught her, and how did we free her?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• We helped change Mengyao’s principle to her current one—Justice. What did we say to change her mind, and what was her old principle?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• While with Mengyao, we stopped her from stealing an important treasure. What was it, and how did we stop her?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• While with Mengyao, we helped her find a new safe place to stay, off the task force’s maps. Where was the place, and who owned it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• With Mengyao’s help, we made a sacrifice to protect citizens of the Lower Ring from a threat. What was the threat? What was the sacrifice? How did it inspire Mengyao to change?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the flashback is finished, the characters should have a shared history with Mengyao, and enough reason to suspect she’s being framed and to want to help her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Players should work together to answer these questions, cre- ating a group story that connects them all to Ba Sing Se, Rangi, and Mengyao.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When starting play, the PCs have already shared encounters with Rangi and Mengyao and have become involved with Ba Sing Se to one degree or another. If you’re using this adventure as the first session of play in a campaign, or as a single session game, then you can further allow the players to call upon their expe- riences with and in Ba Sing Se using this custom setup move created for this adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re using this adventure in the middle of an ongoing campaign, only use this move if the PCs have had plenty of downtime “off-screen” to explore, investigate, and encounter Ba Sing Se. If they haven’t had much time to form connections in Ba Sing Se that weren’t explicitly established in prior play, then don’t use this flashback move.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">When you flashback to a prior exploit or incident you expe- rienced in the location, neighborhood, or district you’ve just entered, mark fatigue and roll with modifiers:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Is this the first time you’re using this move this session? If no, take -1.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Do you blend into, match, or belong to this place? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Were you a known ally of the dominant power in this place at the time of the flashback? If yes, take +1.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">On a hit, choose one. In the prior incident...</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">• You found a resource here that can be of use to someone you know. The GM will say what it is, and you say where you found it or hid it.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• You learned something important here that now seems useful. Ask the GM a question; they will answer it truthfully, and you say how you overheard, discovered, or spied that information in your flashback.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a 7-9, you also encountered some trouble last time you were here. The GM chooses one:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• You insulted someone powerful in the area.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• You caused damage to the area; it’s still under repair.</p>

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• You fought off some local <i>daofei</i>; they bear a grudge.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a miss, you only encountered trouble; the GM chooses two from the 7-9 list.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Players are encouraged to use the move to set up interesting details and solve problems they wish they’d prepared for by inventing new allies and resources. But the cost of the move and the risks associated with it—marking fatigue and taking -1 on every flashback past the first, for example—will dissuade players from overusing the move. The intent is to add interesting texture to the city, not to solve every problem the PCs face.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The questions about the nature of the situation are ultimately best answered in conversation with the GM. <i>“Is this place a relative- ly peaceful part of the city?” </i>is a question about turmoil—in places that are in chaos, it’s harder for a PC to easily find useful help. <i>“Do you blend into, match, or belong to this place?” </i>is a question about the PC’s backgrounds, and whether they match this particular place. And <i>“Were you a known ally of the dominant power in this place at the time of the flashback?” </i>is a question about the PC’s alli- ances—mostly to the <i>daofei </i>or to the Earth Kingdom’s guards. If the PC was known to be committed to one side or the other, they might more easily find help in the area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM has to help fill in the details for all of the results on a hit, and especially the 7-9 results. Keep in mind that those are useful for setting up further moves down the line—the person you insulted doesn’t have to appear immediately, and the dam- age you caused doesn’t have to have immediate consequence, but they are elements at play in that area of the city.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This adventure starts with Rangi meeting the heroes to ask them to help find Mengyao, the culprit suspected in the kid- napping of the Ambassador’s children. Rangi also asks the PCs to keep the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se stable while she leaves to alert the Avatar of what’s going on. <span class="p">The meeting with Rangi is set up before you start play—Rangi contacted the PCs and asked them to meet her first thing in the morning in one of the many shopping centers in the Lower Ring. It’s early enough that some of the shopkeepers are still setting up their stalls for the day. Rangi is dressed for travel and clearly in a hurry. She tells the heroes that she overheard one of Yong’s task force officers mention they were going to raid a shop this morning that may</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be connected to Mengyao. She wants the heroes here in case the officers uncover anything, but she needs to leave immediately. If the heroes try to explain that Mengyao could never do some- thing like this, Rangi really doesn’t have time to hear it; they just need to find the right culprit and save the kids!</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As Rangi is leaving, a group of guards dressed in the telltale green of the Earth Kingdom brush past a shopkeeper into one of the stalls. <span class="p">Rangi gives the heroes a knowing look</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">as she rushes off. The commotion of the guards’ intrusion rings clear through the quiet morning, and the other shop owners retreat into their own shops, afraid to catch the guards’ attention. As the guards overturn pots and dig through wares, loud shouts erupt from the other end of the square. A lone guard grapples with a young man who is loudly declaring his innocence. The PCs are left to intervene or not as they choose, but one way or another, the situation is growing more unstable.</p>
