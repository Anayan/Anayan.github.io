<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se is where the poorest people live, and it makes up the bulk of Ba Sing Se’s population center. Mas- sive walls enclose the Lower Ring, one separating it from the agricultural sectors and another keeping it from the Upper Ring. Four major roads run through the center, cutting it into quar- ters and leading into the interior. The only gates in the walls are guarded by a team of Earthbenders, who lower the stone walls to allow passage. These are manned day and night, and while the guards do not prevent foot traffic, few people from the Lower Ring have reason to travel to the city’s interior.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Under the shadow of the walls, cramped stone buildings play host to a bustling city that sprawls before the eye. Residential areas surround shopping centers, and merchant stalls butt up against rundown homes. The Lower Ring appears to be delineat- ed by neighborhood, neatly grouping people of similar econom- ic and social status together in districts that contain everything anyone would want, from tailors to tea shops and everything in between. During the day, Earthbenders work tirelessly to raise an arching structure over the major roads that will one day be a monorail leading between all the city’s rings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Lower Ring is a bustling place, filled with industrious people going about their days. But since Yong has taken over the <i>daofei </i>task force, everyone walks a little quicker, keeps their heads down, eyes averted, and seems in general less friendly to passersby.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Earth Kingdom guards who are part of the task force patrol the streets constantly. They harass anyone who loiters in the street or lingers at a shop too long. Shop owners are constantly complaining, but silence descends if a guard passes close by.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Walking in the Lower Ring is relatively safe unless you hap- pen to look “suspicious” or “<i>daofei</i>-like,” whatever that means. At any time of day, the task force is busting down doors searching for suspected criminals. Since the kidnapping, things have got- ten even worse. Yong’s Earthbenders have taken an even more aggressive stance, accosting and questioning anyone who looks at them the wrong way. Additionally, Tan and his Firebenders are searching the Ring, causing their own unrest and acting as a thorn in Yong’s side.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where Are the Children?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lei Fang has set up several locations across Ba Sing Se’s Lower Ring where his Mercenaries can meet. While the group often uses Gan’s Noodle Shop for official business and the Wood Frog Lumberyard to hide members, they have several other hiding places across the city. Finding the children is a major part of this adventure, so leave the children’s location up to the actions the PCs take. If the PCs find clues and evidence that lead them to believe the children are in the Lumberyard and then take action on that belief, then the children are likely in the Lumberyard… but the PCs are going to have to overcome multiple obstacles to get there first! A bait and switch where the children are revealed to be in a different location is only appropriate once, as a very hard move, if it’s even appropriate at all.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Wherever the children are, Lei Fang has tasked his Mercenar- ies with keeping an eye on them. Lei Fang ultimately wants to ransom the children after Mengyao is taken down and ensures that a gang member keeps them fed and taken care of at all times—he figures he can pretend that he and Hana found the kids where Mengyao stashed them and then return them in ex- change for a reward. Hana is more ruthless and wants the oppor- tunity to kill some guards when they eventually come looking for the missing Fire Nation children—no better way to build up the Fanged Mercenaries than to prove how dangerous they are. Hana doesn’t much care about what happens to the kids one way or the other and thinks trying to ransom them may be more trouble than it’s worth. The Fanged Mercenaries themselves are divided about how to treat the children, but for now they follow Lei Fang’s orders to keep them happy and healthy.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao’s Hideout</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao keeps a hideout in a shack in one of the poorest areas of the Lower Ring. No one here asks questions, and few people trust the guards enough to talk to them. It’s the perfect place for a solo <i>daofei </i>to lie low, especially when the other street gangs tend to congregate within neighborhoods they can prey on. No one is preying on anyone here; they don’t have anything left to take.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Mengyao’s actual home has already been compromised. She watched from afar as Earth Kingdom guards broke the door down and ransacked the place looking for her, or for any evidence of where she might have gone. Now when she’s not out hunting for the kids herself, she’s holed up in her hideout,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but she doesn’t know how long she can stay hidden there before someone rats her out for the bounty Tan’s forces are offering.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Loongkau’s Lucky Pocket</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This area of the Lower Ring was once completely overtaken by the Triad of the Golden Wing. After Avatar Kyoshi took the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Triad down, other groups moved into the area and set up shop. While the quarter still houses a good number of <i>daofei </i>gangs,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a diverse market dominates the area. The anti-corruption task force likes to make regular stops at the Lucky Pocket, but the warren of underground market stalls makes it hard for them to single out <i>daofei</i>. This has become a great spot for clandestine meetings, under the table deals, and other illicit business, all beneath the notice of the task force’s watchful eye.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The heroes can find any number of <i>daofei </i>who have been personally victimized by Lei Fang or Hana, just as easily as they might run into one of their lackeys. If they ask too many questions there, they are likely to experience pushback. No one wants to alert the task force to the goings-on in the market, and those who aren’t loyal to the Fanged Mercenaries are scared</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of Lei Fang and Hana. Everyone is sensitive about losing their scant livelihoods. If a fight breaks out here, the characters must navigate around cramped hallways and indignant stall vendors. Of course, there are plenty of opportunities to use those same stalls, from noodle shops to cabbage stands, to their advantage.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Gan’s Noodle Shop</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gan’s Noodle Shop is an easily overlooked hole-in-the-wall nestled amid other such shops in the Lower Ring. The outside is unremarkable, with a single grimy window cut into the stone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">facing and a cloth drape in place of a proper door. Few patronize the shop, and Hana picked it as their hideout for that very rea- son. The owner, a pudgy woman named Gan, has been down on her luck ever since the task force came to the Lower Ring. Most of her patrons were <i>daofei </i>seeking to use the closed off back room for secret meetings. When the task force started rounding people up, suddenly the need for meetings at her noodle shop dropped off. When Hana proposed an exclusive deal, Gan was more than happy to oblige.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lei Fang and his Mercenaries operate out of Gan’s back room, and Gan keeps their cover for them. The Mercenaries all have a secret code word they use to get access, and they perform all their planning and covert business behind Gan’s heavy stone door.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Wood Frog Lumberyard</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Wood Frog Lumberyard was once a small woodcutting operation on the south side of the Lower Ring. Its location made it convenient for locals to pick up planks or commission wagons. Unfortunately, when construction on the monorail started, Wood Frog Lumberyard lost their bid to have the monorail relocated</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a mile west to preserve their operation. Earth Kingdom officials viewed the loss of a single lumberyard as far less disruptive than the loss of an entire neighborhood. Additionally, a competitor on the western side of the Ring, being a larger operation, was able to provide a large bribe to put Wood Frog out of business.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">City officials built a low stone barricade around the site and posted signs warning trespassers before the owners could even</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">remove all their belongings. The owners sold off what they could, but the lumberyard is still dotted with piles of lumber and broken-down wagons. Desperate for funds, the owners accepted a small stipend from Hana to use the site for <i>daofei </i>meetings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lei Fang now uses the lumberyard as one of his many hide- outs to evade the task force. His Mercenaries move between lo- cations often, having secret meetings in various locations across the Lower Ring and hiding their gang members from Earth Kingdom guards when they draw too much heat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Lowtown Laundry</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lowtown Laundry is one of the largest washing facilities in the Lower Ring. Here people can purchase bars of laundry soap, wash their clothes in the heated spring the site is built over, or drop off laundry for cleaning services at a hefty fee. Generally, only people from the Upper Ring leave laundry for washing, so Lower Ring residents come and go from the facilities at all times of day and night. This means that Lowtown Laundry’s propri- etor, Hop, knows everyone in the neighborhood, their business, and all the gossip in this area of the Ring.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When Tan and his Firebenders were looking for a place to set up shop, they chose Lowtown Laundry for its central location, but also to put pressure on Hop to give them information about the local residents. Hop has been accommodating so far, but</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he chafes against the Fire Nation soldiers who have completely overrun his place of business.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Firebenders’ presence has driven away business, and their continued clashes with Earth Kingdom guards has caused everyone in the neighborhood to give the location a wide berth. Hop wants them gone just as much as anyone, but they aren’t leaving until they have secured their charges.</p>
