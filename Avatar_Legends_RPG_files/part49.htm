</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you play <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>
<a href="part51.htm#bookmark118" class="s25">, there are a few things you need to prepare and a few things you need to think about as a group. You can read more about setting up the fiction of your game—choosing a scope and era—in Chapter 4 (page 108),</a> but this section outlines some of the underlying assump- tions you should consider before you go through that process!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Preparing to Play</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You need a space to play. If you’re playing face-to-face, you want a table big enough for everybody to sit around it, spread out a bit, put their character sheets down, and roll dice. Make sure you’ve got printed copies of the basic moves and the playbooks ready to go, along with a pair of dice for each player, a batch of index cards or sticky notes, and a bunch of pencils.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If you’re playing online, make sure you’ve got everyone included in your audio or video call and some tools for keeping everyone on the same page: an online character keeper or shared document, an online dice roller, and all the PDFs of the basic moves and playbooks. You can learn more about online tools specifically designed for <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>at magpiegames.com/avatarrpg.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Don’t hesitate to take breaks when needed—while it’s better if nobody stops for a meal in the middle of play, bathroom breaks, snack breaks, stand-up-and-stretch breaks are just fine. No need to rush! Even the Avatar takes a break sometimes to feed the otter-penguins!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Choosing an Era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the most important decisions you’ll make as a group is which era to use for your story. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>features five different eras, four tied to the life of a major Avatar—Kyoshi, Roku, Aang, and Korra—and one that explores the Hundred Year War when Avatar Aang was frozen in ice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">These eras are detailed in <span class="s23">Chapter 2: The World of Avatar</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">
<a href="part20.htm#bookmark63" class="s25">(page 31),</a> including their major events and important people. The eras are quite different from each other, each emphasiz- ing different themes and conflicts. The Kyoshi Era, for example,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">depicts a world beset by warlords and bandits—a time that needed heroes to protect ordinary people as the nations struggle to maintain their borders—while the Korra Era focuses on the arrival of modern technologies as the world grows more inte- grated and connected every day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Spend time as a group choosing an era before you start play! Think carefully about what kind of game you want to play together and pick an era that fits that style of story. Don’t be surprised if a game set during the Hundred Year War focuses on conflicts around the War or if a game set</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">during the Roku Era is dominated by political considerations and shadowy politics. Each era is built to focus on different stories! You can find more on choosing an era in <span class="s23">Chapter 4: Making Characters</span>
<a href="part51.htm#bookmark118" class="s25">, on page 108.</a>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Setting Expectations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stories of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>range from goofy and fun—“My cabbages!”—to serious and dark, like Avatar Kuruk’s battles against dark spirits in the Kyoshi novels or Korra’s battles to cope with her traumas in later seasons of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. It’s important that everybody’s on the same page about what to expect from the tone and style of your</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">game. You have room to nudge the tone according to your table’s choices, and the playbooks you select inherently change the game’s style. But here are some basic elements you always need to think about:</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Growing Up in the Avatarverse</p>
<p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game <span class="p">is a fantasy adventure set- ting inspired by Asian and North American Indigenous cultures, a land filled with breathtaking temples, majestic sky bison, and unique marvels of technology. Yet, it is also a world defined by struggle—there are no truly evil villains or perfect heroes—as people with complex motivations come into conflict with others to forge a future they believe is best.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">All of the characters have grown up in a world with bend- ers, the Avatar, and the Four Nations. They may not know the history of those Nations or how the current Avatar deals with</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">problems, but they know about bending, the general concepts of the Avatar cycle, and the major conflicts of the current era. And depending on the era, they might even be familiar with stuff like metalbending or advanced technologies like mecha suits and Satomobiles!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The companions can be surprised by new and amazing powers, but they don’t walk around in awe that ordinary people can bend the elements or master an incredible fighting style. Those things are a normal part of life if you’ve grown up in the Four Nations.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Your Team</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, you always play a team of heroic, young companions who have stepped up to make the world a better place. The specifics of your team are filled in by the choices you make when choosing your era, scope, and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part51.htm#bookmark118" class="s25">purpose (page 108),</a> as well as when you choose playbooks and make your characters. That said, a few things are always true:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">You are all skilled martial artists. </span>
<a href="part52.htm#bookmark124" class="s25">Regardless of your training (page 116),</a> every one of you is a skilled martial artist prepared to spar and scuffle with competent opponents. Even companions who focus on technology have taken some self- defense classes and can handle themselves in a fight. Nearly every corner of the Avatarverse is filled with people who have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">some degree of training—even if some of those people are non- benders—but all of the PCs are particularly skilled and capable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">You have all answered the call willingly. </span>You might have been pressured to take on the role of a hero (or taken on the role because you feel guilty about your past actions), but you have chosen to be a part of the team.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That’s why your team won’t fracture or collapse at the first conflict—one way or another, you want to be here fulfilling your group’s purpose with your fellow companions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>

<span>
<img alt="image" src="Imgs/Image_111.png"/>
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">You aren’t killers or villains. </span>You’re a team of young heroes. You might have made mistakes or even hurt people in the past. But you aren’t killers or villains; you don’t solve problems by hurting people without regard for the consequences. If your team feels they need to take more drastic action—like killing a dangerous villain to save lives—you might grapple with the complexities</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of killing as a solution to difficult problems. But so far, none of you have crossed that line or gone down that dark path.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">You are friendly! </span>
<a href="part51.htm#bookmark121" class="s25">While some of the other companions might give you a headache or make you roll your eyes at their silly antics, you are all friendly with each other. You might have only met during the inciting incident (page 111)</a> or still be learning about each other, but you know your adventures will draw you closer. It’s okay to be rivals with a teammate—or even a bit jealous of them sometimes—but you all are closer to friends than not. If ever your character comes to believe they</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are entirely at odds with the other PCs—or perhaps even bitter enemies or foes—that’s a sign that it might be time for you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">to make a new companion who fits in better with the group.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">You are still growing and learning</span>. All of the heroes of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>
<a href="part48.htm#bookmark112" class="s25">—regardless of age—are people who are still learning who they are and what they care about. Your two balance principles (page 102)</a> are in tension because you haven’t quite decided what you care about most, and your adventures are in part about discovering what truly matters to you!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Redemption and Loss</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The stories of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>—as ac- tion-packed and fun as they can be—are never truly free of the burdens of loss…or the potential for redemption. Death and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tragedy are common across the Four Nations, and almost no one who grows up during an era of great conflict—like the Hundred Year War—is untouched by the horrors of war. Much of the power of these stories revolves around the hope that heroes bring to ordinary people, the fierce love they have for goodness and kindness, and their ability to stand up for what’s right; the inclusion of great loss and injustice is crucial for the companions to rise to that occasion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">And while some villains appear to be truly monstrous and cruel like Fire Lord Ozai, many of the characters who oppose your companions are not such monsters. Some are ordinary peo- ple with differing perspectives or needs. Others have committed themselves to making the world better but have lost balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and are on the path to making terrible decisions. Just as loss and tragedy are fertile grounds for heroism, conflicts and disagree- ments often start stories of redemption and forgiveness. It’s easy to write off the opposition as villains, but many of the tales of the Avatarverse are about the heroes helping the villains see the damage they have done instead of beating those villains into sub- mission with the elements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>is all about balance—seek- ing it, finding it, <i>and </i>losing it. No story told in this world should ever be simple or easy, nor will it be without hope or optimism.</p>
