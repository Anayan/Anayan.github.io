<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You may be heroes, and you may do your best to uphold balance, and you may try to help people and solve problems with kind words and generous action…but eventually, you’re going to be surrounded by angry waterbending pirates uninterested in your kind words or your generous actions. All they want is that silver boomerang on your back. You can’t <span class="s11">intimidate </span>them—trying to <span class="s11">intimidate </span>them and missing is how you got into this mess. So you pull that silver boomerang off your back, lift it, and get ready. Time to fight!</p>
<p class="s13" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game <span class="p">features a combat system</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">designed to represent the fluidity and push and pull of fights in the Avatarverse. Combatants decide how they approach the conflict, and then take action, using their trained techniques to pull off impressive stunts. You and your foes trade blows in bouts of action called <span class="s23">exchanges</span>, until someone runs, surrenders, or is defeated!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Exchanges vs. Basic Moves</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you dive deeper into the system of exchanges, howev- er, it’s important for you to know—you don’t have to use the exchange system for literally every fight. When a fight pops up—when one PC says, “I’m blasting those guys with wind!”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and “those guys” might fight back—then everyone in your game considers whether or not you actually need to use exchanges and the deeper combat system. The basic moves of the game don’t include any moves specifically about fighting, but <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>and <span class="s11">push your luck </span>can together cover a lot of ground for physical action—including some kinds of fighting!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The difference between using the basic moves to resolve a fight and using the exchange system is all about uncertainty and importance. If the fight isn’t uncertain at all—the enemy combatants have no chance against the companions, whatsoev- er—then the moves don’t really trigger. The GM won’t call for them, let alone the exchange system! There’s no uncertainty,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so the GM just says what happens! This situation is rare— most combatants have a slim chance of making a dent, even if they’re not particularly adept—but if it happens, just keep the conversation moving.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Then, assuming that there is uncertainty—that the players and the GM aren’t entirely sure how this fight can go—use the following ideas to think about whether or not the basic moves can handle the situation. The GM in particular thinks about the following premises when a fight is on the horizon, examining whether each is true or not:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The enemy fighters are just obstacles, not interesting, complex, or difficult opponents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The stakes of the fight are boring—if the companions lost entirely, it would be frustrating and if they won, it would be lackluster.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• This fight isn’t an interesting impact moment on its own—it isn’t the climax of the episode, it isn’t the culmination of the companions’ plans and actions, it isn’t a moment of confrontation with a meaningful or interesting antagonist or villain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">If all of the premises are true, then it’s a great time to use <span class="s11">rely on your skills and training </span>to resolve the fight. On a hit, the PCs handle the low-level enemies, taking them out or running them off. On a 7–9, the enemy combatants fight back, and the PC might suffer a status or a condition, unless they can mark fatigue to get past it. On a miss, the GM makes a move as hard as they like and uses that move to make interesting things happen—be it a much more dangerous enemy arriving (and likely spurring a switch to the exchange system) or the fight accidentally knock- ing over a torch and starting a massive fire! Even in situations where the PCs might be outnumbered, you can still use <span class="s11">push your luck </span>to resolve the fight quickly when the fight itself isn’t actually of interest.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If, however, some of the premises aren’t true—the enemy fighters <i>are </i>interesting, complex, named characters; the stakes of the fight are interesting, and if the PCs lost, it would lead some- where interesting; or the fight itself <i>is </i>the climactic moment of the episode—then that’s a good sign you should switch over to the exchange system. In other words, as a quick rule of thumb:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If there is no uncertainty about the fight, keep the conversation moving.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If there is uncertainty but it’s not an interesting fight in any way—nobody at the table is interested in the actual fight—then resolve it with the appropriate basic moves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If there is uncertainty and someone at the table is interested in the actual fight, resolve it using the exchange system.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Running Exchanges</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the full combat system of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, combat takes place in exchanges, sets of blows, blocks, and dodges that combine into a single fluid sequence. Imagine two foes circling each other then closing , one throwing a fireball and then a leg sweep, the other dodging both attacks before throwing a blast of air into the first fighter, flattening them against a wall. That whole</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">series of blows covers one exchange. An exchange isn’t “You get one punch, and I get one kick”—an exchange covers several individual strikes, dodges, blocks, and moves that you can envision in a flurry of bending, weaponry, and martial skill.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">An exchange begins when the two combatants start moving and striking at each other more than anything else, and it ends right as they break apart, even just for a moment, before diving into a new exchange! Don’t think of exchanges in terms of actual time. Think of them in terms of cinematic tension; a series of attacks back and forth between two foes might be one to three ex- changes or so, before the camera turns to a different set of fighters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Combat exchanges also don’t have to happen in immediate succession—characters can talk to one other or take other actions between exchanges. Imagine two combatants coming together, exchanging blows—a fireball, a wind-blade, a twisting block and counterstrike—before they are hurled apart and rise to their feet, breathing heavily. At that moment, if one of them charges the other, and the other meets the charge, then a new exchange begins. But if one of them starts talking, that might trigger <span class="s11">plead</span>, or <span class="s11">intimidate</span>,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or <span class="s11">call out</span>. If one of them tries to subtly freeze the floor between them, that might be <span class="s11">rely on skills and training</span>; if one of them tries to distract the other to create an opportunity, that might be <span class="s11">trick</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Always remember that the next exchange only starts when the two of them directly physically engage each other. Even if they both focus on defense and maneuvering, or evasion and obser- vation, they’re still taking physical actions that you can imagine in and around the other—one of them trying to get on top of the building nearby while the other lifts an earth shield. As soon as they both recommit to the fight, a new exchange has begun.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Beginning a Combat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You’re interested in this combat, you are uncertain, and you don’t want to resolve it with the basic moves. Excellent! Now, how do you start your fight?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">First things first—the GM makes sure everyone in the fight is clear on the situation. Who is involved in the fight? Where</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exactly are you fighting? What are the surroundings like? Players ask questions of the GM to help clarify the situation as the GM fills in the details. The most important things to note:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• What is the environment like?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Who all is fighting?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• Who is engaged with whom?</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Describing the environment isn’t about clearly stating advantageous features to use in the fight—that’s closer to answering <span class="s11">assess a situ- ation </span>questions, although if someone does <span class="s11">assess the situation </span>then that explains the environment pretty well all on its own. The key here is to ensure that no one in the fight is surprised by an obvious feature. You don’t want a Waterbender to say, “I didn’t know there was a canal running along the road!” halfway through the fight!</p>
<p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Explaining who is fighting—and their positions—clarifies the size and importance of the combatants and gives the PCs one last chance to try to avoid a fight (if that’s even possible). Just like with the environment, no player should say, “Wait, I didn’t realize there were sixty guys standing in the open, ready to fight us!” What’s more, if someone is present but <i>not </i>participat- ing at all in the fight, that’s just as important to note.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Explaining who engages with whom is a critical step in start- ing a combat. One fighter is <span class="s23">engaged </span>with another if they are in reach of each other’s skills, training, and techniques, and if they actively focus on each other. The GM is the primary arbiter of who engages with whom, but every combatant is almost never engaged with every other combatant. Different fighters face</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">off against different foes, saying, “I’ll hold them off,” or “Don’t worry, I’ve got this guy.” Each set of engaged fighters has its own exchanges, and changing who you’re engaged with in a fight is only worth noting if you specified who you were fighting from the start for a fictionally appropriate reason.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Exchange Combatants</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every exchange requires at least two combatants <span class="s23">engaged </span>with each other. It’s not an exchange if one person is punch- ing, but the other person refuses to fight, dodge, block, or respond physically in any way! Both combatants have to be involved in the fight, each responding and reacting in kind;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">if someone insists on just taking each blow on the chin, com- pletely refusing to meet the attacker…then the consequences of those blows just happen in full!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">When a combat starts, however, the GM should split engaged fighters up into their own individual exchanges instead of lumping everyone together into one giant exchange. The Airbender focuses on the Fire Nation guards, while the Earthbender takes on the Fire Nation general herself, and the Waterbender doesn’t participate in an exchange at all—he’s busy dousing the fires on the village! The Airbender vs. Fire Nation guards is one exchange, while the Earth- bender vs. Fire Nation general is a second, separate exchange; the Waterbender isn’t even in an exchange since they aren’t engaged with anyone, making moves when appropriate and joining an exchange only if they jump into the fight!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If the PCs want to gang up on one enemy, they can do that… just so long as there aren’t other enemies who might divert them and peel them off. If three PCs go up against a squad of guards, their lieutenant, and a rampaging spirit, the GM should ask which characters attend to which enemies. Think of it this way: if no PC specifically addresses and focuses on a particular threat, then that’s a golden opportunity for the GM to make a hard move to show what that threat actually does while no one stops them! The more that you can break up exchanges into bouts of three or fewer com- batants, the more effective your combat exchanges will be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Regardless, every player in the game, the GM especially, should make sure everyone understands who is involved in any given exchange, so the companions know exactly who they’re fighting. “Surprise attacks,” which involve one party attacking someone unable to defend themselves, aren’t a part of exchang- es, so combat—an exchange of strikes, dodges, blocks, and so on—isn’t really happening yet.</p>

<a name="bookmark151">Approaches &amp; Techniques</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When an exchange begins, every combatant chooses one <span class="s23">ap- proach </span>to use. Their approach signifies the overarching way they act throughout the exchange. There are only three approaches in the game:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s11">Defend and maneuver</span>—you are blocking incoming strikes with a strong guard, tiring out your opponents, shifting position, knocking down blasts of fire or air sent at you without giving up ground, but seizing opportunities to change your standing or retreat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s11">Advance and attack</span>—you are throwing punches, fireballs, water whips, etc. at your opponent, pressing them and trying to inflict harm, sticking close to your foes to ensure you can strike at them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s11">Evade and observe</span>—you are slipping around blows, twisting just out of reach of your enemy, all the while taking in your opponent, watching them, learning about how they fight, and perhaps even exchanging verbal barbs.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your approach determines the overall style you apply to this exchange in terms of what you’re actually doing—if you’re <span class="s11">evad- ing and observing</span>, you’re not charging and pummeling your foe. What’s more, your chosen approach determines the <span class="s23">techniques </span>available to you within the exchange. In every exchange, each combatant can use one or more techniques, which represent individual moves or actions within the exchange. Techniques allow you to directly affect the other combatants or the envi- ronment around you, perhaps inflicting fatigue or conditions, inflicting or clearing statuses, or even shifting your foe’s balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Every trained combatant in <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>has access to the <span class="s23">basic techniques</span>, the core tactics tied to each approach. Each approach has three basic techniques tied to it, to represent the general set of actions most combatants could undertake when using that approach. If a character isn’t trained well enough to easily and consistently use those basic tech- niques, there’s a good chance they aren’t trained well enough to even <i>be </i>a combatant in a real exchange—there’s no uncertainty when a trained Firebender goes up against a kid who can’t yet consistently create a tiny flame in their palm.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">There are also <span class="s23">advanced techniques</span>, techniques that represent greater training and require time to master. PCs can have advanced techniques at <span class="s23">learned</span>, <span class="s23">practiced</span>, or <span class="s23">mastered </span>levels.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A learned technique is one that the PC has been taught but hasn’t yet successfully employed in combat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A practiced technique is one that the PC has been taught and has used in combat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• A mastered technique is one that the PC has fully mastered by completing a special mastery condition set to them by their teacher.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If an NPC knows an advanced technique, they have it mastered— the GM doesn’t track learned or practiced techniques for NPCs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part85.htm#bookmark205" class="s25">You can find more on advanced techniques and learned, prac- ticed, and mastered levels on page 211.</a> For now, what’s most im- portant to know is that characters use mastered techniques the same way they use basic techniques—with ease and facility. But learned or practiced techniques are harder to use, with greater costs.</p>
<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">NPCs, Techniques, and Changing Balance</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The number of techniques an NPC can use for their approach is determined by 1 + their current balance at the start of that approach. In other words, if an NPC <b>defends and maneuvers </b>and has a principle of</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">+1 at the start of the resolution of the <b>defend and maneuver </b>approach, they get to use two techniques.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">An NPC who shifts their balance before resolving their approach might get a different number of techniques. If a PC uses Strike against that same NPC during <b>ad- vance and attack</b>, thereby shifting the NPC’s balance and increasing their principle to +2, the NPC gets to use three techniques during <b>evade and observe</b>.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The NPC’s balance at the start of their chosen approach is all that matters. Whatever their balance was at the start of the exchange is irrelevant!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Stance Move</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choosing an approach only declares the basic style a combatant uses during an exchange—each combatant still has to choose specific techniques to use. An NPC can always use a number of techniques equal to their balance rating +1. To determine how many techniques a PC combatant can use, they make the <span class="s11">stance move </span>when resolving approaches: each player rolls with the appropriate stat, based on the approach they chose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Use one practiced technique</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Use two different basic or mastered techniques</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">On a miss, you stumble, but you can shift your balance away from center to use one basic technique.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that this means on a miss, you can almost always use one basic technique, but only a basic technique—you can’t use any advanced techniques on a miss, even mastered ones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The disadvantage of using a learned or practiced technique is that you must roll a 10+ on the <span class="s11">stance move</span>, and for a learned technique you must pay an additional cost. But because you don’t choose tech- niques until after you have rolled the stance move, you can always choose to use a basic or mastered technique on a 7–9, even if you were hoping to get to use your learned or practiced technique.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you know who the combatants are in the exchange, follow these steps to resolve the exchange:</p>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 1</p>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 1</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 1</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GM chooses approaches</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">For each non-player combatant in the exchange, the GM choos- es an approach. The GM should note these approaches down but keep them secret—the players don’t get to know what approaches the NPCs chose when they decide what to do. The GM doesn’t choose any techniques yet.</p>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 2</p>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 2</p>

<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 2</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each player chooses approaches</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">For each PC in the exchange, their player chooses their ap- proach. Players should feel free to discuss what approaches they’re choosing, and don’t have to keep it secret. Players don’t choose any techniques yet. If the PCs are fighting each other for some reason—a rare occurrence, but possible—then they choose approaches secretly.</p>

<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 3</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The GM reveals what they chose for each NPC</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The GM reveals their chosen approaches, and any other un- revealed approaches are now revealed, so every combatant’s chosen approach is public.</p>

<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resolve each approach</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Resolve the approaches in order, starting with all <b>defend and maneuver </b>approaches, followed by all <b>advance and attack </b>approaches, followed by all <b>evade and observe </b>approaches. When resolving each approach, PCs who chose that approach roll the <b>stance move </b>to see how many techniques they may use. NPCs use techniques equal to 1 + their current balance as it stands specifically at the start of that approach.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">PCs choose their techniques first, and then the NPCs choose their techniques to use. All techniques within an approach are functionally resolved simultaneously.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part60.htm#bookmark152" class="s49">If anyone is taken out or loses their balance, they don’t suffer those consequences yet, even if their approach hasn’t been re- solved yet. The same goes for statuses (page </a>151)—the effect of the status doesn’t kick in until the exchange ends.</p>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 7</p>
<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 7</p>

<p class="s58" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STEP 7</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resolve being taken out or losing your balance</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Now, whoever has been taken out or lost their balance resolves those effects. If necessary, PCs resolve first, and NPCs second. Remember that because you don’t resolve <b>losing your balance </b>until this step, then before this step, your balance still counts as its highest possible extreme (+3 for PCs, and +1, +2, +3, or higher for NPCs depending upon their status). That means even if a PC loses their balance, they might be able to <b>live up to their prin- ciple </b>one last time with it at +3 before the end of the exchange. Similarly, an NPC still gets the benefit of their high balance in one last exchange before they lose their balance.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">After the Exchange</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The full effects of a character being taken out or losing their balance resolve outside of fight exchanges. While a character might know they are taken out during the <span class="s11">advance and attack </span>approach phase or lose their balance during the <span class="s11">evade and observe </span>approach phase, they don’t actually get taken out until the exchange is over.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">When a PC <span class="s11">loses their balance</span>, their player chooses options, and the GM says what happens without uncertainty—everyone at the table knows that a character lost their balance, and the full effect of that move must come into play. A character losing their balance is at an inflection point for their story!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, when a PC is taken out, they are unable to act any more. The exact details of how they are taken out can be set up outside of fight exchanges—but almost always, a PC being taken out is a golden opportunity for the GM to make another move. That might lead to the PC getting captured or the NPCs acting with impunity to take what they were after or otherwise win the day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Remember that after an exchange ends, there is no require- ment to go right into another exchange. The combatants break apart after their exchange of blows, and maybe they decide to throw words at each other as they breathe heavily and circle each other, looking for a better position. Maybe no combatants want to fight anymore. Maybe a combatant has decided that fighting directly is a losing strategy, so they quickly set fire to their sur- roundings, hoping to distract the companions with danger.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If multiple combatants want to keep fighting, then another exchange ensues. This also covers situations in which one side wants to only defend or evade—they’re still “fighting,” still actively participating in the exchange, even if it’s only to protect themselves. If only one combatant (or one side of combatants) wants to keep fighting—to the extent that their targets won’t even resist incoming blows—then no exchange is needed; the attackers simply inflict fatigue or conditions on their targets. And if no combatants are engaging each other, then there’s no need for an exchange at all!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This also helps sort out when a fight’s fully over. If all combatants on one side of the conflict are defeated, unable to continue fighting in any way, then no more exchanges are needed! The GM uses the drives and balance principles of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">involved NPCs to determine how they react, as well. If a group of soldiers have their leader knocked out by the PCs, then sol- diers with a drive “To survive” are going to run! Similarly, if all the PCs are defeated or flee, the GM can decide how the NPCs react—capturing the PCs, fleeing themselves, etc.—based on their drives and balance principles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">For the most part, long combats that run for many exchanges until both sides are totally exhausted are quite rare in <span class="s13">Avatar Leg- ends: The Roleplaying Game</span>. Instead, both PCs and NPCs usually take the chance offered by the end of an exchange to pursue new tactics, offer a truce, or get away from the fight!</p>
