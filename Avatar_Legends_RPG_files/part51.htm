<span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>requires your group to first set the stage for your story by making some big decisions about your game’s theme, the setting, and each player’s character. This process means working with everyone else, whether you’re a player or the GM, and ensuring everyone is heard. Everyone at the table has equal say in deciding all of the following elements of the game: <span class="s23">era</span>, <span class="s23">scope</span>, <span class="s23">group focus</span>, and <span class="s23">inciting incident</span>. Together you will craft a background for your game that leaves everyone excited to play to find out what happens!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Setting Up Your Game</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you make your character, roll any dice, or confront any villains, you and your group need to set up your story. The Avatarverse is enormous, covering huge amounts of territory and hundreds of years, and you’ve got to select which parts you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">want to focus on and what you hope to accomplish as heroes. The groundwork you lay before you play is crucial to ensuring that everyone gets to have the experience they want playing the game!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This initial phase—the <span class="s23">setup phase</span>—requires your group to do a lot of talking about what kind of game you want to have. Don’t be shy! If you want to focus on a particular part of the setting or the history, tell your group. Together, you all can work</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">together to find a setup for your story that meets everyone’s needs. And if you’re going to use safety tools like lines and veils or the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part10.htm#bookmark15" class="s25">X-Card (page 12),</a> the setup phase is a great time to introduce them and establish how your group will use them during play.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You’re going to be making some big decisions and establishing important facts about your game’s story during this phase. But don’t worry, you don’t need to keep all of this in your head! As you decide on each component of <i>your </i>story, write it down on the <i>Campaign Creation Worksheet </i>(see Appendix C) in the play mate- rials to keep track of it. Think of the worksheet as a reference tool, like the “plot bibles” TV writers create and use to keep track of all the important things they need to remember about the show! It’s likely you’ll return to that sheet in later sessions to refresh your memory about what you decided during this phase!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before you do anything else, you need to decide on which <span class="s23">era </span>of history your game uses as a backdrop. You, another player, or the GM might already have a strong opinion on what era to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">play in—that’s great! Just make sure everyone at the table is just as excited to play in that era too. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>offers five eras to choose from, each tied to the span of an Avatar’s life (except for the Hundred Year War Era) and each focuses on distinct themes that define the type of game you play. Here’s a quick list of the base emphasis and details of each era (described in more detail in <span class="s23">Chapter 2: The World of Avatar</span>):</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Kyoshi Era </span>covers the events right after <i>The Shadow of Kyoshi </i>novel. Play in the Kyoshi Era if you want to fight in battles against rogues and bandits and deal with governmental corruption as the nations establish their borders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s23" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roku Era <span class="p">covers the time right after Sozin became Fire Lord and before Roku married. Play in the Roku Era if you want to deal with tensions between different nations and the trials of main- taining an uneasy peace.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Hundred Year War Era </span>focuses on the time just before Avatar Aang’s awakening at the beginning of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Hundred Year War Era if you want to rebel against unjust rule, protect the weak, and stand up to tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Aang Era </span>is set after the events of the <i>Im- balance </i>comics trilogy, some time after the end of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Play in the Aang Era if you want to heal the world after tragedy and help push it into a brighter future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s23">The Korra Era </span>covers a period that takes place after the events of the <i>Ruins of the Empire </i>comic trilogy, some time after the end of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. Play in the Korra Era if you want to deal with the repercussions of imperialism and play in a modernized era.</p>

<a name="bookmark119">Choose a Scope</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you know <i>when </i>your game takes place, it’s time to decide <i>where </i>it takes place! The <span class="s23">scope </span>of your game measures how much of the Four Nations you expect to explore over the course of play. Are you interested in having every episode take place somewhere new or would you rather zoom in on just one location and explore its residents’ struggles? Using your era as a guide, pick a scope for your game and describe it on the <i>Campaign Creation Worksheet</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">If your scope is broad</span>—extending across the whole Earth Kingdom, the entirety of the world’s oceans, or the whole world—you might sail by ship or fly by bison from destination to destination, solving problems which affect multiple states and peoples. Avatar Kyoshi and Avatar Aang both had stories with extremely broad scopes, going on adventures that required them to travel the whole world. A broad scope might focus on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Water Tribe refugees from the South Pole traveling north to seek shelter in the capital of Agna Qel’a during the Hundred Year War.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">If your scope is narrow</span>—focusing on Ba Sing Se, or Agna Qel’a, or the Foggy Swamp—you might explore a single region or city in greater depth and detail; you might occasionally</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">visit outside locations but always return to your original site afterward. Avatar Korra’s story had a narrower focus in Season One of <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, centering on Republic City’s complex power politics. A narrow scope for your own game might deal with protecting Kyoshi Island and the Avatar’s legacy from an outside threat or invader in Roku’s Era.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you’ve determined your scope, briefly describe it on the <i>Campaign Creation Worksheet </i>
<a href="part101.htm#bookmark245" class="s25">(“Fire Fountain City,” “the Si Wong Desert,” “the islands of the Southern Archipelago,” etc.). Your scope isn’t set in stone and can change over the course of play. If it does, though, that’s likely an indicator you’re moving on to a new season of your game (page 255)…</a>
</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Nadja, Izzy, Tyrelle, Seiji, and Ruhan are starting up a game along with their GM. They’ve already decided to set it within the Korra Era, but now they need to talk about the scope of their game.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“To help give us a starting point, is anybody here interested in a roaming game, the kind where you visit a new place every episode?” the GM asks. Some of the players indicate a bit of interest, but no one expresses a strong desire.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“And what about a game with a more specific setting, where we’re in the same place every episode?” This time, Seiji and Tyrelle both speak up.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 5pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, I think I’m interested in really developing a cast of char- acters in the same location,” says Seiji.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“I’m less interested in episodic, isolated plots,” says Tyrelle. “So I think I want to be in a single consistent location where everything strings together.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“Awesome,” says the GM. “We should think about specific locations or areas.” The rest of the players nod.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Obviously, we could do Republic City,” says the GM. “We can also do Hari Bulkan in the Fire Nation, or Ba Sing Se in the Earth Kingdom. We don’t even have to do a city—we could do just a larger area that keeps us focused, like one island near the Northern Water Tribe. Or we could do an Air Temple! Anything jumping out to anyone?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Republic City sounds pretty great, actually,” says Izzy. “It has the spirit portal now, it has plenty of rebuilding to do after the Earth Empire attack, there’s all kinds of stories and characters who can be there.”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, I’m interested in playing a Yuyan archer, but Republic City can really have any kind of character in it, so that sounds good to me,” says Ruhan.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">With that, the group settles on their scope—Republic City!</p>

Your group focus is the purpose which first united your companions to achieve a common goal. Your characters might disagree about how to achieve it, but they all believe the goal is so important that it’s worth risking danger and changing their futures.

<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Any ideas about what you want to play with?” asks the GM. “I would love to do more stories around the spirit vine weap-</p>

<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“For me, the Triads of Republic City are pretty interesting,” says Nadja.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Well, what if we combine those? The Triads are getting their hands on illicit spirit vine technology!” suggests Tyrelle.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“So let’s do ‘To defeat an enemy’ as our focus, and have the enemy be some big Triad boss!” says Seiji.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“I kind of like the idea that we’re investigating, though, and we don’t know who we’re up against,” says Ruhan. “What about, ‘To protect Republic City’ from the spirit vine weapons?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The rest of the group agrees—they like the idea of a game with an investigative, intrigue element as they search for the illicit spirit vine weapons in Republic City!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whatever you choose, the group focus is a problem too compli- cated to overcome in one episode (or game session). It’s the kind of thing that takes an entire season of a show or volume of a comic series to solve. You don’t need to fill in all the details about the group focus right now, but consider some of the following ques- tions to make sure it’s robust enough to push the story forward:</p>

<a name="bookmark121">Outline the Inciting Incident</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In order to flesh out the group focus, you need to create an <span class="s23">inciting incident </span>to start your game off with some action! The inciting incident is the plot of your series’ “pilot episode,” the story of how the companions met one another and committed themselves to your group focus. If your group focus is “to rescue a rebellion leader” during the Hundred Year War Era, for exam- ple, your inciting incident will explain important details like how your characters met, why they care about rescuing this person, who captured them, and who wants to stop you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The inciting incident is not a full session of play; instead, you craft it together at the table like a few good friends retell- ing an epic escapade that happened the week before. Choose options that are interesting—but leave them open-ended, since you’ll need to fully understand your characters before you can fill in all the details!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Start by picking a place within your scope where this incident happened. Then, as a group, choose three of the following—one for each act of your opening story:</p>

You can use any of the items or characters you came up with when setting up your group focus, but you can also invent new villains, items, allies, etc., as you need them. Just connect the three events to ex- plain how your companions met and where your adventure goes from here. Try not to get caught up in explaining everything. It’s important to keep things general, because your characters don’t exist yet and there needs to be room for expansion later on.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Now we set up our inciting incident!” says the GM. “We know we’re in Republic City, and the thing that connects the group is a shared interest in stopping the illicit spirit vine weapons. With that in mind, any of the Act 1 options seem interesting?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“‘We discovered a secret hidden by a powerful figure’ makes a lot of sense,” says Nadja. “We have to have learned about the spirit vine weapons, right?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Cool! Who’s the powerful figure, then?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“The leader of a new Triad…the Iron Cloud Triad!” says Seiji. “Yeah! We found a hidden cache of spirit vine tech in Iron</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Cloud territory!” says Tyrelle.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Excellent!” says the GM. “What about Act 2? Did you steal some of that tech? Or maybe you destroyed it?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, I definitely think we destroyed it,” says Iris. “And we drew the ire of its owner…who is the same guy, right?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“That’s just fine, though!” the GM says. “We’re reinforcing how important that NPC is. Or, we can always revise the NPC includ- ed in the Act 1 prompt—what if the secret you discovered was this series of hidden chambers in the rebuilt parts of the city, not the actual spirit vine technology? So someone participating in the reconstruction of the city after the Earth Empire attack had these special, secret labs hidden there, and now they’re researching spirit vine weapons with the help of local Triads!”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh, that’s awesome!” says Ruhan. “And can we say maybe they’re like a competitor of Future Industries? They’re originally from the Fire Nation, and their company is…Ember Global!”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Wait, what if it’s like a new executive of the known rival of Future Industries—Cabbage Corp? They can still be from the Fire Nation, but they’re in charge of Cabbage Corp special proj- ects, and they’re trying to secretly research spirit vines, using the Triads for protection and black market supplies!” says Izzy. Ruhan nods in agreement!</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“All of that is fantastic!” says the GM. “So to recap, in Act 1, you discovered a secret hidden by this executive of Cabbage Corp. Let’s give them a name…Ihing Shuryao.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“So Ihing used Cabbage Corp resources to help rebuild after the Empire’s attack, and hid this secret set of chambers un- derneath the new structures. You discovered those along with the spirit vine testing and tech inside. And then in Act 2, you destroyed that equipment and incurred the wrath of the leader of the Iron Cloud Triad…let’s give them a name…Ben Luo. And what about Act 3? Any ideas?” the GM asks.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">“I don’t think we saved or rescued anybody, and I don’t think we defeated anybody,” says Tyrelle. “Maybe we were rescued?” “I like that we’re on our own in this investigation, though, and</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">we don’t know who to trust,” says Seiji. “Can we say that we narrowly escaped capture by another foe, someone who makes us doubt the people who should be helping us? What if it’s a corrupt guy in the police force working for the Triad?”</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">“Ah, that’s great!” says Nadja.</p>
<p class="s46" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Awesome!” says the GM. “Let’s say his name is Quan Sun, and he’s actually considered a pretty upstanding officer by most everybody else, so no one suspects him. And with that, we’ve got our inciting incident!”</p>
