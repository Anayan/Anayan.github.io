<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Reaching the Spirit Library is difficult at best, but never impossi- ble. The exact methods available to a sojourner change a bit from era to era, of course, depending upon where the library is.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Getting to the Library</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sojourners always had several different ways to reach the library, though the viability of those methods fluctuates over the eras. Across the times of Avatars Kyoshi, Roku, Aang, and Korra, there are primarily three ways of reaching the library: spiritual meditation, traveling across the Si Wong Desert to its physical location, and traveling through the Spirit World.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Spiritual Meditation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A sojourner can always try to reach the library by meditating and connecting to it through the Spirit World. The library may have been in the physical world for millennia, but it’s always</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a spiritual place, and it’s not impossible to reach it through spiritual methods. Someone might be drawn there if their spirit connects to the library, or they might spiritually project there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">That said, this kind of access is incredibly difficult, beyond the ability of all but the most spiritually balanced gurus and mas- ters. In your game of <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</span>, this kind of access is best reserved for dramatically appropriate mo- ments and GM moves, as opposed to something PCs can choose to do at will. In rare cases, some characters might be able to <span class="s11">rely on their skills and training </span>to cross, but even the most spiritually attuned PCs must <span class="s11">push their luck </span>in the best of circumstances.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Roku, Kyoshi, and Hundred Year War Eras, the Spirit Li- brary is in the desert, and a sojourner can try to reach it by cross- ing the Si Wong. It’s a dangerous journey in any era—the desert is harsh and enormous, full of its own predators and threats.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The move above is for crossing the Si Wong Desert to reach any destination, though it has some special options that apply to the Spirit Library. Use this move both to reach the Spirit Library, and then to find a way back to a safe oasis or town.</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Try to cross the Si Wong Desert to reach a specific destination” <span class="p">means you must have some sense of where you’re going. This move isn’t for idly wandering in the desert!</span>

<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<i>“Do you have a knowledgeable guide?” </i>is a question about whether you have aid from someone with desert expertise—most likely one of the Si Wong tribespeople. The tribespeople can help a sojourner reach the library (or any destination in the desert); they have the equipment, knowledge, and expertise necessary, though of course, a few other guides might be available. That said, a Si Wong tribesperson guide is always superior—if your knowledgeable guide is a tribesperson, the GM picks one fewer option on a 7–9 or miss. Either way, a PC must usually convince their guide to help out, most likely using their basic moves—be it by <span class="s11">pleading</span>, <span class="s11">tricking</span>, or even <span class="s11">intimidating</span>.</p>

<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you have easy access to flight?” <span class="p">is a question about one of the simplest ways to both travel and scout the desert. Aang and his friends found the library more easily because they traveled on Appa’s back—anyone with a flying bison has a real leg up in traveling the desert (although the expertise of a Si Wong tribes- person can’t be beaten).</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Are you traveling with someone attuned by balance principle to your destination?” <span class="p">is a question about your traveling companions. If someone traveling has a particular spiritual or mental connec- tion to your destination, then that can aid in the journey. If you’re traveling with someone whose balance principle aligns perfectly to your destination—like someone with a principle of Knowledge for the Spirit Library—then the answer here is also yes.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you have ample supplies?” <span class="p">is a question about the great dangers of the desert—the heat, the sun, the lack of water and food. If you have supplies, food, and water, you can survive the desert far more easily, taking the time you need to safely cross it. If you lack those supplies, however, you must cross the desert quickly and desperately or you won’t reach your destination.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Are you traveling to the Spirit Library in the Kyoshi or Roku Era?” <span class="p">is a question about how easy the library is to access within the current era. It’s a bit easier to find and get into the library in the Kyoshi and Roku Eras than in the Hundred Year War Era, when it is still further sunken into the sand.</span>
</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You are exhausted and your supplies depleted” <span class="p">means exactly what it says—traveling across the desert is very difficult, and it can leave you tired, thirsty, hungry, and barely able to continue on! This option can be chosen twice on a 7–9 or miss result, thereby hammering home the costs of the journey.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“You run afoul of the dangers of the desert along the way” <span class="p">means that you encounter something unexpected and dangerous along the way. You don’t have to play through the incident—the move handles the encounter offscreen, whether it’s hallucinatory cactuses or buzzard-wasps. Instead of needing to play out the encounter, </span>“You lose an important tool or resource, especially to find your way back.” <span class="p">You manage to get through the incident, but in the process the Si Wong tribesperson’s skiff is damaged, or you lose your map or compass.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“You draw attention to yourselves” <span class="p">means that something is tracking you and when it catches up, it will cause you a whole new headache. </span>“Something has followed you to your destination; the GM chooses what it is and when it reveals itself” <span class="p">means that this result doesn’t have to immediately lead to a hard move, but can set up something down the line. A desperate treasure hunter who lost his way could be tracking you and appear when you reach your destination, or some desert predator like a sand shark could be hunting you. This encounter picks up when the GM brings it into play.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“If you are traveling with a Si Wong tribesperson, the GM always chooses one fewer option from the list, even on a miss” <span class="p">means that you are aided especially by the expertise of the Si Wong tribes- people. If you have a Si Wong tribesperson guide, you answer “yes” to </span>“Do you have a knowledgeable guide?” <span class="p">and receive this additional benefit.</span>

Deal with the danger and maybe you can reach the library.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Aang Era and Korra Era, the only way to reach the library is to traverse the Spirit World itself, be it through astral projec- tion or by physically passing through a spirit portal. Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library still exists, but in the strange, mutable land- scapes of that other world. In the Aang Era, because access to the Spirit World is still rare, the library is most often out of reach unless characters find some way into the Spirit World. In Korra’s Era, anyone can pass through the portals at the North and South Poles and in Republic City to seek the library. In every case, though, finding the library in the Spirit World is no simple feat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Note that this move can be used to guide a whole group to the library, but only one PC rolls to lead the rest. All the ques- tions of this move are asked of that single guiding PC. Other PCs cannot help with the roll by default—the roll and questions have to do with one character’s ability to navigate the fluid and non-physical nature of the Spirit World. The best way for other PCs to assist is by helping the guiding PC reach their center or clear their conditions before the roll.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Questions</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Are you at your center?” <span class="p">is a question about your balance. If your current balance is at your center, take a +1! Your centered spirit and mind allow you to better navigate the Spirit World.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Do you have a spirit guide?” <span class="p">is a question about your allies. If you have a spirit leading you to the library, then you have a spirit guide! If you are being led by some other figure who has often made the journey, then they might count even if they are not a spirit, at the GM’s discretion.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you have two or fewer conditions marked?” <span class="p">is a question about your state of mind. If you have zero, one, or two condi- tions marked, then the answer is yes. But if you have three or more conditions marked then the answer is no, and you take -1.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Do you have valuable knowledge to grant?” <span class="p">is a question about whether the library helps draw you in. If you have something that Wan Shi Tong wants to add to his collection or learn, then the answer is yes! But if you don’t have some special object of knowledge, then the answer is no, and the library doesn’t wel- come you.</span>

<p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Spirit World and Bending</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">During the Aang and Korra Eras, when the library is located in the Spirit World, mortals who find them- selves there may wind up even further at the great spirit’s mercy! Human benders who pass into the Spirit World through meditation or spiritual means, leaving their body in the material world, cannot bend on the other side. Benders who pass through a spirit portal and wind up in the Spirit World with their material bodies can still use their abilities. The spirit portals are only opened in the Korra Era, with one portal each at the North Pole, the South Pole, and Republic City.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">In play, this means that a bender who passes into the Spirit World and leaves their physical body can- not bend at all with any move; they’re likely to wind up <span class="s108">pushing their luck </span>quite a bit!</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Note that those trained in weapons will have no difficulties continuing to use their training, and technology-users will similarly be able to use their own skills—although in both cases, spirits may be disturbed by the disruptive presence of weapons and tech in their world.</p>

<p class="s42" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“On a hit, you arrive at the library at its current place in the Spirit World” <span class="p">means you’ve made it! The Spirit World is ever-changing, so the library isn’t always necessarily at the same place every time…but wherever it is, you have guided yourself there. You— and all those you led on the journey—arrive at the doorstep of the library, ready and prepared to enter.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“On a 10+, you can enter without Wan Shi Tong noticing right now” <span class="p">means you have a chance to sneak into the library without running into Wan Shi Tong. The guiding PC and companions can slip into the library unnoticed without any uncertainty,</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but as they maneuver about and through the library, especially searching for information, they might need to make further moves to stay hidden.</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“On a 7–9, you are greeted by the great spirit himself” <span class="p">means you have no chance to slip inside—you must deal with Wan Shi Tong before you can make it within. You might try to run or bar- gain—though only fools would try to fight outright—but Wan Shi Tong stands between you and the library.</span>
</p>
<p class="s22" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“On a miss, you find yourself mired in a danger of the Spirit World, with the library visible nearby. Deal with the danger and maybe you can reach the library” <span class="p">means that you’re nearby—the library is reachable—but you have to deal with a threat first, be it a dangerous spirit, stinking spirit-muck, or something else. The GM will tell you what the danger is, exactly.</span>
