<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In terms of how NPCs <i>behave</i>, here are a few guidelines to make your characters more three-dimensional:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Look to your <span class="s23">agendas, guidelines, and moves </span>to determine how they act. In particular, remember that there’s no such thing as pure evil.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Use the <span class="s23">NPCs’ drives </span>to determine what they want and how they get it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Use any <span class="s23">conditions </span>marked on them to determine their emotional state and to modify their actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Use their <span class="s23">principle </span>and their <span class="s23">current balance </span>to determine how committed they are to their ideals—the higher the principle, the more obsessive they grow, and the less open they are to changing their mind. It might be possible to get them to change how they act by <span class="s11">calling them out </span>and appealing to their deep investment in their principle, but <span class="s11">pleading </span>with them, <span class="s11">intimidating </span>them, or <span class="s11">guiding and comforting </span>them in ways that conflict with their principle all become more and more difficult.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• If appropriate, you can <i>inflict fatigue or conditions </i>on an NPC or <i>shift their balance </i>based on the fiction. If they become dramatically Angry or become highly committed to their principle, note this down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">• If they <span class="s23">mark a condition </span>or <span class="s23">shift their balance </span>while</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“on-screen,” make them react—have them take action that shows the change. This works even in combat—the NPC can react between exchanges, or might alter the goal they have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the fight (thus picking new approaches or techniques). If an NPC winds up marking multiple conditions rapidly, it’s often simplest to choose a dominant one and play to that…or to play up how rapidly stressed out they are, suddenly filled with conflicting and dramatic emotions!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">NPCs In Combat</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Companions will inevitably fight NPCs. How the fight turns out depends on the NPCs’ importance and the decisions the PCs make during the conflict.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Minor NPCs </span>are “mooks,” “henchpeople,” of middling importance. They get tossed around easily and make the companions look cool by losing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They showcase how awesome the companions are given their training and techniques.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Major NPCs </span>are capable, challenging obstacles. Defeating them shouldn’t take too long, but they might escape (perhaps even before defeat, if they feel they’re losing) and return later—with a vengeance!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s23">Master NPCs </span>are clever, motivated people with their own goals and principles—they rarely risk their lives foolishly and gladly flee if the chips are down. Unlike major NPCs, their motivation for escape tends not to be out of fear, but out of a desire to return better prepared.</p>
<p class="s107" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What about NPC vs NPC fights?</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">What should the GM do if an NPC fights another NPC, and no PC intervenes or participates? Sim- ple—just say what happens. If no PC is involved or takes action, the GM just decides what happens, based on their agendas and guidelines. If the PCs aren’t even present, the GM can just tell them what they hear about the outcome. If they’re watch-</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">ing, they can still dive in and try to interrupt the fight—but until they do, the GM can just say what happens, inflicting conditions, marking fatigue, and shifting the balance of their NPCs as they see fit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For exchanges with important NPCs, keep the following in mind:</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">NPC Techniques and Behavior</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Remember to assign the foes techniques appropriate to their importance and group size; you don’t have to pick them all in advance, but keep them consistent once you choose them for a given NPC.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• Foes must choose approaches in combat exchanges and use techniques equal to 1 + their current balance per exchange.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• The more important the NPC, the more likely they will retreat before total defeat, or change their target to something achievable. Important NPCs are intelligent</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and don’t stand around to be defeated—except of course, when they do, in which case, make it dramatic!</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">NPC Fatigue and Conditions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If an NPC must mark a fatigue, and cannot, they mark a condition instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part48.htm#bookmark111" class="s25">• If an NPC must mark a condition, and cannot, they are taken out. Follow the normal rules for being taken out (see page 101).</a>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">NPC Balance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If an NPC shifts balance off the edge of the track, they lose their balance. They must make a choice from the <span class="s11">lose your balance </span>move at the end of the exchange (they still get to use their techniques as chosen). If the NPC has previously lost their balance—even in a prior session—endeavor to select a different option than</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">what they last chose, so they never pick the same option from the <span class="s11">lose your balance </span>move twice in a row.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• After an NPC loses their balance, shift their center—they’re guaranteed to start all future fights at a different balance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: left;">• If an NPC’s center shifts off the edge, it means they go through a fundamental change, either picking a new principle, or retiring entirely from play—forever imprisoned, giving up all ambition, or (rarely) dead.</p>
