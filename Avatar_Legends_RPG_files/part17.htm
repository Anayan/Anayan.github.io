<a name="bookmark22">The Fire Nation</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation covers an archipelago dotted with active vol- canoes to the west of the Earth Kingdom. Originally, the noble clans of the Fire Nation held a great deal of influence and power, sometimes equal to that of the <span class="s23">Fire Lord</span>—the official ruler of the Fire Nation. However, after the Camellia-Peony War during the Kyoshi Era, the power structure steadily shifted so the Fire Lord alone governed the nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Until the reign of Fire Lord Sozin and the Hundred Year War, <span class="s23">Fire Sages </span>acted as the religious authorities of the Fire Nation. These influential spiritual leaders conducted their affairs at the High Temple in the Fire Nation Capital. The Sages were heavily invested in Fire Nation history and kept extensive documenta- tion of it within the Dragonbone Catacombs beneath this tem- ple. Because they were highly involved in political matters, they were no strangers to intrigue and taking sides during conflicts. Ozai held no interest in spiritual matters, however, and the Fire Sages lost much of their power during his rule.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark83" class="s25">The Fire Nation was responsible for the Air Nomad Genocide (page 59)</a> and subsequent Hundred Year War during the reigns</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part40.htm#bookmark98" class="s25">of Fire Lord Sozin and his successor son and grandson, Fire Lords Azulon and Ozai, respectively. When Ozai’s son Fire Lord Zuko rose to power, he spent much time and effort trying to repair the damage of his predecessors by dedicating funds, people, and atten- tion to restoration efforts. Under his reign, the Fire Nation pivoted away from waging war and towards efforts to support world harmony, such as the creation of the United Republic of Nations (page 82)</a> from former Fire Nation colonies.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation Capital</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A sprawling city built atop and within an island volcano</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation Capital is the home to the royal family and the seat of government. There is a harbor for ships, a High Temple for the Fire Sages, a prison, and a network of tunnels beneath the city perfect for conducting secret operations. The Great Gates of Azulon, built in the time of their namesake, protect the city. To fend off outside threats, guards raise a net between the two great dragon statues and a statue of Azulon and set it alight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The wealthy elite of the city live in Hari Bulkan, housed within a dormant volcanic crater. The Fire Nation Royal Palace is located here along with the Coronation Temple and Plaza. The path up the volcano to Hari Bulkan is protected by a series of strategic switchbacks, designed by Fire Lord Sozin, which force anyone making the ascent to walk in single file.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Other important districts include the industrial Harbor City and the nearby Royal Plaza, which is not only remarkable to behold, but strategically lined with battlements from the Roku Era to slow down any attempted invasion. Many of the common- ers in the capital live in Harbor City and suffer stigma for living there—they are of a lower status than people who can afford to live in other districts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">The Fire Nation Capital is also home to the Royal Fire Acad- emy for Girls, a prestigious military academy educating female youths in combat and strategy. The school is intense—in some eras so competitive that deaths have occurred during an Agni Kai, a rare and tragic occurrence that exemplifies how the acade- my fosters competition to the point of fanatic perfection.</p>

<a name="bookmark58">Fire Fountain City</a>
</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An ancient city with mystical roots</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Originally called North Chung-Ling, Fire Fountain City is best known for its role in the Camellia-Peony War during the Kyoshi Era and its contribution to the Fire Nation’s war efforts during the Hundred Year War. Since the Hundred Year War, it’s been</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a highly industrialized, modern city with numerous bustling districts to explore and get lost in. It is located on Shuhon Island in the eastern part of the Fire Nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The city was originally a seedy tourist trap hawked as a “spiritu- al destination”, cashing in on the hallucinogenic effects of the flam- mable vapors lying below the land. During the Hundred Year War, it became an important industrial city integral to the Fire Nation’s military power. The fountain, for which the city was renamed, is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a massive statue of Fire Lord Ozai built during the Hundred Year War that shoots fire out of its hands and mouth.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bhanti Island</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An island of Fire Sages with a magical healing pool</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sages have lived on Bhanti Island in the south of the Fire Nation for thousands of years. They live isolated from the rest of the world and choose to remain uninvolved in its troubles. The temple on the island is made of several stone pagodas, and un- derneath is a cavern with a pool of water that can heal the gravest of injuries. The island’s Sages used these waters to heal Avatar Korra after a dark spirit attacked her and she lost her memory.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The island is also home to a large library containing multitudes of tomes of spiritual knowledge, including details about dark spirits and how to deal with them. Avatar Kuruk and Fire Sage Nyahitha used this library for research to help them in their grueling battle against dark spirits.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sun Warriors’ Ancient City</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A forgotten city and home to dragons</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This ancient city built around firebending dragons is labyrin- thine and guarded with traps to capture any unwanted visitors. The Sun Warriors, the city’s inhabitants, were the first people to master firebending after humans left the lion-turtle cities, and their bending is more strongly connected to the sun than other Firebenders. Two dragons—Ran and Shaw—live in their ancient city with them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For thousands of years, the warriors have guarded the Eternal Flame—a fire given to them by the dragons ages ago and kept eternally burning. Since the Sun Warriors live in isolation, from the era of Avatar Roku onwards, the world believed that both the dragons and the warriors were extinct until Avatar Aang en- countered them again. In truth, the dragons live in their ancient city and while Fire Lord Sozin’s tradition of hunting dragons for glory nearly depleted their entire population, they and the Sun Warriors survived.</p>

<p class="s26" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Agni Kai</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Agni Kai is a ceremonial Firebender duel between two opponents, which technically ends when one op- ponent burns the other. It is often used as a high-stakes way to settle scores between two parties when one, or both, feels egregiously harmed by the other. It also con- firms a person’s social standing by proving one a better Firebender than the other. An Agni Kai is a grave matter and Firebenders don’t engage in the duel lightly—not only because it can be deadly, but because anything agreed upon based on the outcome of the duel must be upheld by the loser.</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Any Firebender can be challenged to an Agni Kai, even the Fire Lord. However, this rarely happens as Fire Lords are supremely powerful Firebenders who are not often known for their mercy.</p>
