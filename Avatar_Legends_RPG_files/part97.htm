<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combat exchanges run a little differently than the rest of the game. They’re a little more “crunchy” or rules-focused. However, remember that combat doesn’t occur for combat’s sake. When characters fight, it’s because they feel they must use force to achieve their goals. While force and violence are more common in the Avatarverse, it must still be justified by what the combat- ants want—few people get into a fight just for the heck of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Keep that in mind when running combat exchanges: rare is the NPC who simply participates in exchange after exhausting exchange, ignoring their own wellbeing. If an NPC <i>does </i>do so, it’s because they’re distracting the companions from something more important, or have gone berserk in some way, or feel they need to sacrifice themselves in order to prove a point. More often, NPCs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">take different actions after an exchange, taunt or speak to the com- panions, or otherwise attempt to achieve their goal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Managing spotlight</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Think of an exchange as active contesting combatants trading a bout of blows—not a “round of combat.” This might mean a single punch or a flurry of quick attacks. It may involve bending or might not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">If all the companions are in a fight with multiple opponents, it’s a good idea to split exchanges up into groups. You can switch between these groups to provide every player the spotlight, and allow PCs to use techniques to shift from one to the other, or to make moves in between exchanges.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">So as not to focus too much attention on one PC, think carefully before introducing one-on-one duels. These should have a good reason: maybe it’s an Agni Kai and a PC has to prove themselves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe one PC is distracting a major villain while the others evacuate a village. In such cases, make sure the other PCs (who are not fighting) do something meaningful, and shift the spotlight</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">onto them after each exchange. If the other PCs have nothing to do, you should involve them in combat with more foes (henchpeople, minions, or lackeys could arrive at the scene, for instance).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Crafting tension</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even combat exchanges can get boring if overused. You can keep exchanges interesting by varying the stakes of fights, the environ- ments of fights, and the tactics of fights.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Make sure that not every fight is about who is left standing; few combats should ever be “to the death.” Think about what the combatants want and how fighting helps them get it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Also think about fun scenery for action, and make sure you don’t repeat the same kind of scenery too often. A crowded bazaar, a rickety bridge, a series of stepping stones in a rushing river, and the treetops of a forest all offer different environmental obstacles and opportunities for a fight. Make your NPCs make use of the environ- ment, employ what’s found in it, attack it, and change it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">To vary the tactics of fights, don’t have NPCs make the same choice over and over. A clever opponent doesn’t strike over and over. Retreating, advancing, taking hostages, putting things and peo- ple in danger—a fighter might do all these things to gain an edge.</p>

<p class="s79" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">he companions have been caught in the mid- dle of a daring prison break, where they tried to rescue Lukta’s imprisoned friend, Kiwaku. They had a plan, but they were caught at</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I’d usually prefer to <span class="s82">evade and observe</span>, but I don’t have any fatigue to clear yet. So yeah, let’s do that,” says Kayla. They both choose to <span class="s82">advance and attack</span>.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM reveals the guards’ approach—every-</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exactly the wrong moment when Haki’s older sister, Kyoko, recognized him! She had been visiting the prison to fulfill her role as a junior minister of the Fire Nation, and out of a sense of duty to her coun- try, she revealed her own brother. Now, the group</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is surrounded by Fire Nation prison guards, the dangerous warden Jiawei, and Kyoko herself!</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM starts by establishing who engages with whom. “Okay, so what do you all do? You’re facing several opponents, but I think you have a chance to split up and engage them on your terms.”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">There are functionally three opponents facing the PCs, including the guards (currently a small group of minor NPCs, but they might grow in num- ber as more arrive), Warden Jiawei (a major NPC), and Kyoko (a master NPC).</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -2pt;text-align: center;">Haki’s player, Hector, is quick to answer—”I’m definitely engaged with my sister. She’s my problem.” Kayla is concerned with how much water her Waterbender, Kirilaq, actually has to work with—this</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">whole place is designed to deprive Waterbenders of water, after all, so Kirilaq probably only has what</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">she brought in her hidden water satchels. Kayla says Kirilaq will try to handle the regular guards, then.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Beryl and Quartz have been arguing lately, so Bei says that Beryl will join Kirilaq against the guards, and Quartz should go fight the warden. Quinn, voicing a bit of Quartz’s frustration, agrees. Lex, as Lukta, asks Haki if he needs backup against Kyo- ko—Hector, as Haki, shakes his head. “I need to do this myself,” he says. Lex agrees to have Lukta join Quartz against the warden, then.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM decides to turn attention to the fight between Kirilaq, Beryl, and the guards. This fight is happening simultaneously with the other fights, and in the same general space, but it’s more manageable to break the large conflict into individual exchanges.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM first decides what the guards do, writing it down on a piece of scrap paper. The guards’ drive is “to fulfill their duty,” so the GM decides to <span class="s82">ad- vance and attack</span>. Then, Kayla and Bei both decide what they want to do. The two of them go back and forth a bit:</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Maybe we should just both <span class="s82">advance and attack</span>, try to hit them very hard up front,” says Bei.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">one chose <span class="s82">advance and attack</span>! The two players roll the <span class="s82">stance move</span>, each one rolling with <span class="s62">Passion</span>.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kayla gets an 8, but Bei gets a 4! Bei decides to shift Beryl’s balance away from center, toward Role in her case, to be able to pick a single basic technique to use. Kayla similarly can use one tech- nique (although it can be advanced). The guards</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">currently have a balance of 0, so they get to use one technique as well.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kayla decides that Kirilaq will use Strike against the guards. “Excellent!” says the GM. “What does that look like?”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“I think I pull water out of my bag, stretch it out in my hand into a big ice javelin, and vault into the crowd of guards, spinning the spear around me the whole time!” says Kayla.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“That’s awesome! And it kind of sounds like you’re really exerting yourself, are you marking the fatigue for your Strike?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Definitely,” Kayla responds. “I want to hammer them, inflict 2-fatigue on them as I scatter them.”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great!” says the GM. “And Beryl?”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Hm. I want to use my Cross Slash technique,” says Bei.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“Ah, unfortunately, on a miss, you can only use a basic technique, even when you shift your balance,” says the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh yeah, I forgot. Alright, then I use Pressure against them. As Kirilaq throws them everywhere, I’m running around the edges of the scrum, knock- ing them back in. I want to make sure they can’t <span class="s82">evade and observe </span>next exchange; they have to fight us or defend against our attacks.”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Perfect, yeah,” says the GM. “So the guards are just going to use Strike, as they swing their big</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">spears around, trying to stab and jab at Kirilaq. They aren’t going to mark fatigue, though, so Kirilaq, how do you want to take the hit?”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Kayla thinks for a second, and then says, “I think I can shift my balance. I’ll go toward Friendship— me and Beryl, we’re a heck of a team!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Wait,” asks Hector. “I thought the guards were swinging spears at Kayla. Why does shifting her balance toward Friendship mean suddenly she doesn’t get hit?”</p>

</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great question,” says the GM. “They’re pressing Kirilaq, stabbing and attacking, pushing her—and Beryl—pretty hard. Kirilaq manages not to get hit, but barely, and it changes how Kirilaq sees herself and her relationship with her friends. If the guards had marked fatigue, they’d get to say how Kirilaq absorbed the hit and it might be more direct…but as it stands, Kirilaq is still one step closer to losing her balance!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">“Gotcha,” says Hector.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great. So it’s this awesome scene where Kirilaq leaps into the air, vaulting into the midst of the guards and then moving like the wind. The guards respond as best they can, getting in a few hits here and there, but thanks to Beryl running around the edge of the fray, they are sort of off-balance and unable to get away,” says the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah, and we get this moment as I duck under one of their blows where my eyes meet Beryl’s, and I’m grinning madly. This is awesome, and here and now I love working with this team,” says Kayla.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Excellent! Okay, next exchange!” The GM turns attention to Quartz and Lukta against the warden. “The warden is squared off against the two of you. He puts his hands out to either side, and you realize they’re covered in special gloves…which promptly ignite, turning his fists into fireballs. Okay, time to pick stances!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM records the approach for the warden secretly. The warden’s drive is “to squash trouble with excessive force.” The GM thinks about that for a mo- ment—the Warden could just <span class="s82">advance and attack</span>, but the longer the Warden delays, the more guards will show up. The warden probably prefers to wait until there’s way too much force for the PCs to stand a chance, so the GM chooses <span class="s82">defend and maneuver</span>. The GM lets the players know they’ve made a choice, and then Quinn and Lex start to chat.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I think we just want this guy out of our way, so I can get to Kiwaku. I’m thinking I might try to escape by Seize a Position with <span class="s82">defend and maneuver</span>,” says Lex.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“No, we should definitely take him out! Take him captive! Use him as leverage to get what we want!” says Quinn. “We should both <span class="s82">advance and attack</span>!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I’m nervous about that, we don’t really know for sure how tough this guy actually is,” says Lex.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“He’s a major NPC, for sure,” says the GM—no reason to hide what kind of NPC the warden is, the players will figure it out the instant they learn how many conditions he has, or how long his balance</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">track is. “He also seems like a pretty competent fighter—that hand-fireball technique is distinctive.”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah, okay, I’m going to <span class="s82">defend and maneuver</span>,” says Lex. “I really just want to get to Kiwaku and get out.”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Aw, no fun. I <span class="s82">advance and attack</span>!” says Quinn. The GM reveals that the warden is going to <span class="s82">de-</span>
</p>
<p class="s82" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">fend and maneuver<span class="s79">. First, Lex rolls for Lukta’s </span>stance move <span class="s79">and gets a whopping 12, while Quinn roles for Quartz and gets a 10!</span>
</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Lex starts thinking out loud about what to do. “Oh, hmm. I could use Ready and Seize a Position, but I have this one technique, Smoke Bomb, I’m trying to advance. I have it at learned, so I could use that and get it to practiced, right?” Lex asks.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Yeah, definitely! Keep in mind, though, that it’ll cost a fatigue because it’s only learned,” replies the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Wait, won’t Smoke Bomb affect me, too?” asks Quinn.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: right;">“Yep. Smoke Bomb says it impairs everyone in the area, and you’re definitely in the area, Quartz.” “Sorry, Quartz!” says Lex. “That’s what I’m do-</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing, I throw a smoke bomb to try to clear a way past the warden to get to Kiwaku!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Awesome. Well, the warden gets two techniques because his Balance is at +1.”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Wait, hold on, I just <i>Impaired </i>him! Doesn’t he get one fewer technique?” asks Lex.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“New statuses only take effect next exchange, be- cause everything is happening simultaneously. For now, he’s going to use Retaliate for sure, standing ready to be attacked, but he’s also going to slap his two flaming hands together and pour just a torrent of fire out—and I think he aims at Lukta. He does not like the Water Tribes. He uses the technique Fire Stream; he’ll mark 3-fatigue, but he inflicts <i>Impaired </i>and <i>Doomed </i>on you, Lukta. You’re on fire!” the GM says. Lex lets out a displeased noise, and the GM turns to Quinn to find out what Quartz does.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">“I want to use Strike and my mastered technique, Rock Column! He’s already <i>Impaired</i>, right? So that means now he’s <i>Trapped</i>!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Strictly speaking, the warden is not yet <i>Impaired </i>because the status takes effect next exchange. But the GM thinks the move makes sense.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Technically he’s <i>Impaired </i>in the next exchange, but yeah, I like it—the smoke bomb throws him off so the rock column can pin him. Yeah, that works. What do you actually do, Quartz?” asks the GM.</p>

It’s both the Strike and the Column! And I’ll mark the 1-fatigue to hit him where he’s weak, inflicting a condition!” Quinn says.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Great! Yeah, so Lukta throws the smoke bomb but not before the warden sends that torrent of flame at them. And then just as Lukta catches fire, Quartz throws that pillar of rock into the warden, smashing against the wall, trapping him, and inflict- ing a condition!” says the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Alright, now it’s down to Haki! You and Kyoko are circling each other, it’s super intense, your mar- tial forms kind of mirror each other, right?” Hector nods. “Awesome. Okay, let me pick an approach.” The GM secretly picks an approach for Kyoko, and even though Kyoko doesn’t have any fatigue to clear yet, the GM thinks she would try to appeal to her brother’s Tradition principle, first and foremost,</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so the GM wants to make sure Kyoko can use Test Balance. They pick <span class="s82">evade and observe</span>.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Hector then picks Haki’s approach: “I don’t really want to fight my sister! I’d rather get her to leave me alone. Maybe I can shift her balance, get her out of here. I want to <span class="s82">evade and observe</span>!”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The GM reveals that Kyoko chose the same approach! “It’s perfect, this is both of you barely engaging each other, just circling and talking, maybe throwing out a token blow or two, but never expect- ing them to hit. Okay, Haki, make the <span class="s82">stance move</span>!” Hector rolls and gets an 11!</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I want to use Test Balance on Kyoko, for sure—I’m pretty sure her principle is something like Patriotism,” Hector says. The GM checks their notes and sees that Kyoko’s principle is actually Duty, but the GM sees if Haki hits that principle anyway.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“What do you actually say to Kyoko, Haki?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Uh…‘So, this is what you are now. You pick your country over your own family? You pick your country over right and wrong?’ I think I’m trying to push her balance higher, I want her to go over- board,” says Hector.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Perfect,” says the GM. Even though Hector didn’t <i>exactly </i>say the right principle, he’s close enough, especially with the actual things Haki said to Kyoko. “Her principle is Duty, but I think you nailed it; she seems troubled by your words. Mark</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fatigue, and I’ll shift her balance. What other tech- nique do you want to use?”</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“I think…I think I’m gonna use Commit. I bet she’s going to shift my balance toward Tradition, so I’m going to shift my balance toward Progress. I’m steeling myself to find a new way forward…without my sister,” says Hector.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Amazing! Yeah, and that was a good call. She’s definitely going to use Test Your Balance in return. I think it’s fair to say your sister is well aware that Tradition is one of your balance principles, right?” asks the GM.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, definitely,” agrees Hector.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Perfect. So she’ll mark fatigue and shift you back toward Tradition. ‘This isn’t what I am now, this is what I’ve always been, and what you’re supposed to be. We are a <i>part </i>of this nation. That’s who our fam- ily has always been. Stop fighting it!’, she says.” Even though Kyoko now has a balance of +1, she only gets to use one technique this exchange because her balance was only a +0 at the start of the <span class="s82">evade and observe </span>approach.</p>
<p class="s79" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">“Okay! So that ends the exchange!” says the GM. “We’ve got Kirilaq mired in the middle of a bunch of guards while Beryl—riding Ochin—keeps herding them back to the fight; Quartz is pinning the war- den against the wall with a rock column, shrouded in smoke; Lukta can run past to look for Kiwaku, since the warden is <i>Trapped</i>, but they’re on fire; and Haki and Kyoko are trading barbs and circling each other, looking for an opportunity to strike! Awe- some! Instead of going right into the next exchange, let’s focus on Lukta, their clothes aflame, running past, into the prison proper. Lukta, as you get past the smoke, you can hear the alarm bells being rung all throughout the prison, and the flames on your clothes are definitely burning you—mark 1-fatigue. What do you do?”</p>
