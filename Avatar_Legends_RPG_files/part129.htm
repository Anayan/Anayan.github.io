<p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The greatest minds from all nations of the world gather for the Four Nations Summit &amp; Technological Symposium in the Fire Nation, each hoping to be the delegation with a breakthrough finding that will one-up their academic rivals. Just as the summit begins, the Fire Nation delegate Khuchtei announces that multi- ple crates of precious meteorite metal were stolen from the Fire Nation and must be returned! Everyone at the summit is under suspicion, and if the thief isn’t found soon, Khuchtei is willing to take extreme measures. Taqukaq, Avatar Roku’s waterbending teacher and one of the summit delegates, tasks the heroes with finding the thief before it is too late. Can they uncover the truth and restore peace before mistrust turns to war?</p>

<p class="s15" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using This Adventure</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The contents of this adventure create a sandbox for your PCs where they can investigate mysteries, unraveling diplomatic intrigue that could shape the history of the world. Some of the tools available to you are found in these sections:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• The “Summary” gives the broad strokes of the adventure, detailing the problems in Hari Bulkan and some possible solutions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• The “Introduction” explains how the PCs found themselves at the center of the secrets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Important Characters &amp; Groups” describes the NPCs the heroes will meet, including motives they may have.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Important Locations” details the three most important buildings, what’s going on in them, and which important characters can be found there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “GM Advice” contains guidance and suggestions to help the GM ensure the adventure runs smoothly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -6pt;text-align: justify;">• “Pregenerated Characters” is a set of five premade characters your players can use to hop right into the adventure. We also include a hook that ties the characters to the adventure.</p>
<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">No Path to the End?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are used to running adventures with heavily detailed encounters and prepared NPCs, it might come as a surprise that few mechanics are written into this adventure, beyond the esca- lations and some information about various characters. <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>relies on players triggering moves based on the actions they take during play instead of asking players to make any specific checks for specific actions required by the adventure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since every significant action a PC takes drives the action of the game forward, <b>there is no prescribed order of events</b>. Instead, the adventure puts the PCs in a dramatic starting situ-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ation that demands immediate action from the heroes! It’s your job to use the material in this adventure to keep things moving, providing interesting events and NPCs to consistently engage your players.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">You can read more about running <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Role- playing Game </span>in the core book, <b>Chapter 8: Running the Game</b>, and more about how moves shape play in <b>Chapter 3: Funda- mentals of Play</b>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<span class="s10">Using the Pregenerated Characters </span>There are five pregenerated characters at the end of this adven- ture. Each character has a unique history, playbook, and set of stats. Your players can use these characters to play through this adventure, or they can create their own as explained in the <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The pregenerated characters have their moves, feature ele- ments, and techniques already chosen; players need only decide whether to shift their balance by one step at the start of play, and which principle to shift it toward. Players can adjust the pregen- erated characters to make themselves more comfortable, altering names, look, and even mechanical elements like the stat boosted by the free +1 at character creation if they are familiar enough to make that choice. The characters are designed to work well with the current elements included and the adventure as presented, but as always, if the GM and player agree then they can make changes as desired. After selecting the pregenerated characters, players will still go through the process of filling out connections with each other.</p>
