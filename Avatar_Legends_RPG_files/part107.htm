<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library had existed in the physical world for millennia, but that doesn’t mean it’s an entirely physical place. The library was always a piece of the Spirit World brought to the physical world. Throughout the ages, there have been re- ports of those of true heart and intent finding the Spirit Library in strange places, stepping through a doorway and then standing before Wan Shi Tong himself, or falling asleep while reading an ancient scroll and awakening amid its shelves. But the most de- termined adventurers could always make the grueling trek to the Spirit Library’s physical location. In the early eras, that’s in the Si Wong Desert—but later on, the Spirit Library moved back entirely to the Spirit World.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The following section explains the library’s location</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">throughout the various eras. To read more about the different eras and the important events mentioned below, take a look at the <span class="s13">Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game </span>core book <b>Chapter 2: The World of Avatar</b>.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The Early Eras</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Throughout the Kyoshi, Roku, and Hundred Year War Eras, the Spirit Library occupied the same physical location in the Si Wong Desert. But the desert is a living thing, dangerous and changing.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the Kyoshi Era<span class="p">, the Spirit Library is detectable by the few remaining towers poking out of the sands of the desert. The full shape of the library had long since been buried deep within the sands, though the contents are kept entirely safe. For enterpris- ing academics and scholars, the best chance of actually arriving at the library is always to travel with the aid of the local Si Wong Tribes. These peoples have a long history in the desert, with a culture well-adapted to the shifting sands, the scorching sun, and the lack of water. The tribespeople often trade with Wan Shi Tong, delivering valuable texts and knowledge in exchange for access to the library’s archives and its useful information.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">A sojourner with something to offer a tribe might hire a sand-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">bending guide and their desert skiff to safely arrive at the library. Otherwise, the sojourner is on their own to cross the desert and hopefully spot the few remaining spires from a vast distance…</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the Roku Era<span class="p">, the library has sunk deeper into the sands.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where once the Si Wong Tribes might have helped keep the sands away, their association with Wan Shi Tong has grown more and more fraught. The sojourners of knowledge who last came to the library soured the great spirit on humanity, as many of them were not interested in knowledge for knowledge’s sake, but instead sought ways to gain an advantage for their nation over the others. He blamed the Si Wong tribespeople for the actions of those they delivered to the library, banning them from any future access to the vast repository of learning. Without rea- son to return, they no longer help keep the library from sinking deeper beneath the sands. A mortal who seeks the library could still potentially find it, especially with the help of the last few</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Si Wong tribespeople willing to share that knowledge, but the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">journey is more fraught, and Wan Shi Tong gives every one of them a colder reception.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the Hundred Year War Era<span class="p">, access to the library is more difficult than any of the prior eras. Some still try to reach the library, but most no longer believe it worth the risk. Some of the Si Wong Tribes pass down knowledge of how to find the library, but they rarely visit. The last visitor of any note to arrive at the li- brary was Zhao, then a low-level officer in the Fire Nation Navy. He gave Wan Shi Tong knowledge of Fire Nation war machines, and then sought the source of Waterbenders’ power, discovering the existence of Tui and La, the Moon and Ocean Spirits, and through them a plan to eliminate waterbending. He and some fellow soldiers then destroyed the Fire Nation section of the library. Wan Shi Tong remains infuriated by Zhao’s offenses and destruction. Only the barest tip of the library’s tallest tower is visible above the sands now, and Wan Shi Tong is fine with that.</span>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Aang and Korra Eras</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Near the end of the Hundred Year War, Aang and his friends sought Wan Shi Tong’s Spirit Library to learn how to defeat the Fire Nation. Wan Shi Tong allowed them to enter, with the pro- viso that they not seek knowledge for destructive purposes. Ulti- mately, the Avatar and his friends found out about the Day of the Black Sun, when Firebenders would be powerless, but Wan Shi Tong in turn discovered their reasons for seeking knowledge. He decided that enough was enough, and he sank the library into the sands fully, returning it to the Spirit World.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the Aang Era<span class="p">, the library is now gone entirely from the physical world. It exists only in the Spirit World, although Wan Shi Tong’s Knowledge Seekers do still find their way back into the physical world to continue to add to the collection. Wan Shi Tong himself is now incensed with humanity, and the Avatar</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in particular. Some lucky few might be able to reach the library through spiritual communion, or even by traveling to the Spirit World…but even then, their pursuit is dangerous. Wan Shi Tong does not want visitors and is just as likely to chase them or lash out as he is to let them in, even if they bring new knowledge.</p>
<p class="s88" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">In the Korra Era<span class="p">, Wan Shi Tong’s opinion of humanity is poised to change. Wan Shi Tong for a time allied with Unalaq, believing that Unalaq better served spirits than the Avatar ever did. He thought that Unalaq might help bring an end to humans’ destructive, terrible tendencies, and that he might then continue his pursuit of knowledge without the threat of greedy humans. But when Unalaq revealed his true plans, Wan Shi Tong was shocked—he had not anticipated the extent of the imbalance Unalaq sought to inflict upon the world. Avatar Korra success- fully defeated Unavaatu and then kept the spirit portals open, leading Wan Shi Tong to reexamine some of his beliefs.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Now that humans can try to reach the Spirit Library by pass-</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing directly through a portal, Wan Shi Tong has decided to give them a second chance. He still requires every visitor to bring new knowledge to the library and remains wary, watching to ensure no human tries to learn simply for the sake of power. But he is willing to do his part to bridge the gap between spirits and humans—for knowledge’s sake, if nothing else. After all, humans have made so many incredible advancements in knowledge that his Knowledge Seekers have not discovered them all…his best way of learning may now be through humans themselves.</p>
