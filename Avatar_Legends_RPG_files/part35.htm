<p class="s10" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Where We Start</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Aang Era specifically details the state of the world just after the conclusion of the <i>Imbalance </i>comic trilogy. The Hundred Year War is finally over thanks to Avatar Aang and his team. This era is one of hope after a long stretch of strife. It is a time of possibility, coopera- tion, and healing, restoring balance to the world. For the first time in</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">years, the nations have a chance at true cooperation, but many strug- gle with embracing the forgiveness needed for collaboration. Plenty fight against progress towards social and political cooperation, and those who cannot change find themselves left behind, holding onto narrow-minded attitudes that are quickly becoming outdated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fire Lord Zuko now sits on the <span class="s23">Fire Nation </span>throne after joining forces with the Avatar to stop his father, and he faces unhappy citizens who’ve made attempts on his life. Aang and Zuko work to repair the damage done by the Fire Nation during the war, but de- spite their best intentions, it hasn’t always turned out the way they’d like. Decolonization is well underway in the <span class="s23">Earth Kingdom</span>
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark90" class="s25">. The Harmony Restoration Movement (page 70)</a> was intended to es- tablish balance among the nations by moving Fire Nation colonists back to the Fire Nation, but it wasn’t universally embraced. Many people didn’t want to be forced out of settlements they had lived in for so long, and multicultural families did not want to be broken up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">While some in the Earth Kingdom strive to remain integrated, other places push to separate—and not always due to nationality, but also to increasing tensions between benders and non-benders. This is exemplified by the bending supremacist uprising in Crane- fish Town. Though the Avatar and his team stopped the uprising, plenty of people (most of them benders, though not all) believe only benders should be in leadership roles. Tensions caused by the bending supremacist movement aren’t going away any time soon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s23">Water Tribes </span>face their own obstacles on the path</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part36.htm#bookmark92" class="s25">towards healing. The Southern Water Tribe slowly works on reconstruction after a century of extreme hardship during the war, but rebuilding has come with its own set of problems… The Northern Water Tribe assisted in the Southern Reconstruc- tion Project, an endeavor meant to repair its sister tribe, only to make a play for the South’s valuable oil depository. Maliq (page 73),</a> an engineer sent by the Northern Water Tribe, believed that oil-fueled machinery created equality between non-benders and benders, but the Southerners ultimately forced him and the other workers to withdraw.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">This era is a surreal time for many people—the first time in a century when the nations haven’t been in direct conflict. A generation of children who’ve only known war finally get a taste</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of peace. Some wounds, such as the genocide of the <span class="s23">Air Nomads </span>or the loss of loved ones during the war, cannot be repaired. Even so, there is more promise for the future than in over a century, and the heroes of this era must see that promise fulfilled.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Avatar Aang</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part31.htm#bookmark81" class="s25">Avatar Aang is technically over a hundred years old, but is actually just a teenager. When he was twelve, he learned he would become the next Avatar and fled his responsibilities in fear. He was caught in a storm and reflexively entered the Avatar State, freezing himself and his sky bison Appa in an iceberg for protection. Fire Lord Sozin launched his attack on the other nations instigating the Hundred Year War (page 56)</a> while Aang and Appa remained frozen for nearly a century. When he awoke, Aang was stunned to learn that the world was at war and devastated that his people, the Air Nomads, were all dead. Now, he is the only living Airbender, though he has recently started mentoring a group called the Air Acolytes to keep Air Nomad culture alive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Aang has been busy since coming out of the iceberg. With the help of his friends, he fought Fire Lord Ozai and brought an end to the Hundred Year War, kept civil unrest from breaking out</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the former Fire colonies, and halted a bending supremacist uprising… just to name a few of his activities. Aang had to grow into his role, as all Avatars do, but he truly wants to see balance restored to the world and is willing to put in the work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part40.htm#bookmark98" class="s25">In his personal life, he has started a romantic relationship with Katara, a Southern Water Tribe Waterbender, and cement- ed his unlikely friendship with Fire Lord Zuko. Aang and Zuko’s friendship has a special importance in the world of diplomatic relations, as it serves an essential part of restoring balance between the Four Nations. Now, Aang and Katara spend much of their time and attention on the industry-focused Cranefish Town. Aang hopes it becomes a thriving, inclusive community despite the problems it has faced. Little does he know that this area is destined to become one of the most important cities in the world—Republic City (page 82).</a>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">People all over the globe confront the trauma they suffered throughout the war and find ways to move forward as best they can. For those who lost loved ones, homes, or parts of their culture like the Southern Water Tribe did, the path forward is especially challenging. Not everyone heals the same way, and one person’s healing journey might be another person’s night- mare. Someone who heals themselves by investing all their energy into doing something productive may not understand someone who needs time alone to heal.</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">
<a href="part35.htm#bookmark90" class="s28">Each nation is experiencing political and societal changes, and so are their citizens. Some of these changes are more painful and face more resistance than others, such as when Fire Lord Zuko and Earth King Kuei tried to move Fire Nation colonists out of the Earth Kingdom (page </a>70). Even those who want</p>
<p class="s27" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">to embrace change and growth may become impatient when things don’t change fast enough or when they run into obstacles along the way. The path towards the future of the Four Nations is a rocky one, but at least there is a path.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The Four Nations were divided for a century, and now people must learn how to coexist alongside each other. Some are eager to go out and explore a diverse world and see what it has to offer or what they can contribute to it, but others wish for na- tions to isolate themselves. Some believe decolonization means all people should return to the land of their ancestors, while others feel integration is the way to achieve peace. One way or another, the world must learn how to operate now that the Fire Nation is an ally instead of a foe.</p>
<p class="s41" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GM MOVES:</p>

<p class="s27" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">New technologies bring limitless possibilities to the world, but not everyone is happy with this rapid push into the future. The Southern Water Tribe struggles with holding onto its cultural identity while also embracing rapid industrialization and ren- ovation. Meanwhile, technological advancement in Cranefish Town means non-benders can find more work than ever, but at the same time, benders are being made redundant by machines. These seeds of discord took root, splitting the inhabitants of the town right down the middle and giving birth to the first bending supremacist movement. Now, aftershocks of that movement’s insurrection ripple throughout the world.</p>

<a name="bookmark90">Important Events</a>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is a list of important events, which occur leading up to and during this era. Each event has a list of the current consequences for the stories you craft in this era.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The End of the Hundred Year War</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Only a couple of years ago, Avatar Aang brought an end to the war with the help of allies from all nations. The final battle took place when Ozai had just named himself Phoenix King and Azu- la was crowned Fire Lord in her father’s stead. Both Firebenders were greatly empowered by Sozin’s Comet flying overhead, which amplified their firebending powers, but Aang still took</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on Ozai while Zuko and Katara battled Azula. Meanwhile, the Avatar’s other allies, including Uncle Iroh, Toph Beifong, Sokka, and Suki, halted the advance of the Fire Nation airship fleet into the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">After Aang defeated Fire Lord Ozai and stripped him of his bending abilities, Ozai was imprisoned for his crimes in Hari Bulkan Prison near the Royal Palace. Now, Fire Lord Zuko gov- erns the Fire Nation as the world grapples with how it has been changed by the war, from the genocide of the Air Nomads to the existence of new multicultural post-colonial societies.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Avatar Aang is the only Air Nomad left.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Fire Nation citizens face stigma for their nation’s actions during the war.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Many people now come from multicultural backgrounds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Harmony Restoration Movement</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not long after the end of the Hundred Year War, Earth King Kuei and Fire Lord Zuko made an agreement to extract Fire Nation colonists from the Earth Kingdom. The first year went smoothly, and people from the newer colonies were excited to return home. However, the movement met resistance when the citizens of the much older colony of Yu Dao refused to relocate. Many had been there for generations, and even some Earth Kingdom citizens fought against the movement to protect their friends and family. Not all Earth Kingdom citizens felt that way, though, and many took to the streets to protest letting the Fire Nation colonists stay. Both King Kuei and Fire Lord Zuko sent troops to Yu Dao, and war very nearly broke out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Luckily, Avatar Aang and his allies prevented the battle from escalating, and the movement ended with Yu Dao electing a new government with both Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation representatives. On the international stage, Fire Lord Zuko and King Kuei signed the Treaty of Yu Dao helping to secure peace between their two nations. Additionally, Zuko agreed to pay war reparations to the Earth Kingdom to help them rebuild, which was an unpopular choice with some Fire Nation citizens.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Fire Nation colonists still live in the Earth Kingdom.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Many people on both sides are unhappy with how the movement ended.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• The Earth King and Fire Lord both face criticisms for how they handled the movement.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">New Ozai Society Uprising</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The New Ozai Society is a clandestine group whose goal is to reinstate Ozai as Fire Lord. They see Zuko as a weak Fire Lord who does not prioritize his people the way his father did. The group launched attacks on Zuko and his family, but were de- feated. Though the leader, Ukano, turned himself in, the group has many members with some still at large. Ukano truly did not trust Zuko, but he was manipulated into attacking the young Fire Lord by Azula, Zuko’s sister, who threatened Ukano while she was disguised as a dark spirit.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part37.htm#bookmark94" class="s49">• A group of Kyoshi Warriors (page 75)</a> now protect the Fire Lord.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Reconstruction Project</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Southern Water Tribe started to rebuild and modernize with the help of its northern counterpart and the other nations, but tensions between the two tribes is an obstacle. Hakoda, the Head Chieftain of the Southern Water Tribe, agreed to work with two architects from the Northern Water Tribe to urbanize Capital City and its surrounding areas. They built an oil refinery, but the North intended to take control of the oil, believing the South inadequate to manage the resource. Gilak, a warrior from the Southern Water Tribe, led a group against the northerners but fell to his death in an attack. The threat of violence has calmed since Gilak’s death, but conflict between the two tribes is still palpable.</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Southern Water Tribe citizens are still unhappy Hakoda, the Southern Water Tribe chief, wants cooperation with the North.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">• Relations between the North and South are strained.</p>

<p class="s24" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bending Supremacist Uprising</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the rapidly growing Earth Kingdom settlement of Cranefish Town, some benders lost jobs to new machinery operable by anyone. Many of these benders harbored feelings of superior- ity over non-benders, and unrest broke out between the two groups, with non-bender workers targeted for violence and a</p>
<p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part39.htm#bookmark96" class="s25">ban proposed on public acts of bending. An Earthbender factory owner named Liling capitalized on the growing chaos and organized a group of bending supremacists to sabotage business- es with the aim of putting the town under bender control. The Avatar and his friends ended this movement, but the bending supremacist sentiment has not vanished and has a lasting impact on the world beyond this era (page 80).</a>
</p>
<p class="s42" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current consequences:</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• More and more benders lose their status as skilled workers.</p>
<p class="s21" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">• Many non-benders accrue wealth and status thanks to machines that can now do the work of benders.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Though Aang is the only Airbender in the world, Air Nomad culture lives on through the Air Acolytes—a group created by the Avatar dedicated to keeping Nomad traditions alive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes originated from the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, which was so popular it had several chapters in different locations. At first, Aang was skeptical of the members’ desire to incorporate all things Air Nomad into their lives, but he now teaches the acolytes all about Air Nomad celebrations, practices, stories, and philosophy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Air Temples are still in rough shape after the Hundred Year War and decades of disrepair, but with the number of Air Acolytes growing, it may be time to start repairs soon. There are relics to reclaim, lost lives to honor, and old responsibilities to uphold. The path forward may not be entirely clear, but as Aang continues to gain new allies in the form of the Acolytes, the future looks brighter and brighter.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notable Figures and Groups</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Xing Ying</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Avatar Aang Fan Club president turned Air Acolyte</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Xing Ying, one of the first Air Acolytes, made a bad first impres- sion on Aang because she had Airbender master tattoos despite not being an Airbender. As the president of the Yu Dao chapter of the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, Xing Ying learned every- thing she could about Aang and the Air Nomads. Her love of the culture inspired her to get the tattoos, but she failed to realize how doing so was disrespectful to Air Nomad tradition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Now, Xing Ying wears a headband to cover up part of her tattoo but continues to study Air Nomad culture with great enthusiasm. Prospective Air Acolytes would be wise to spend time traveling with Xing Ying before joining. Though Xing Ying prefers resolving conflict through communication, in unavoidable fights she is very capable of defending herself. When possible, she always tries to bring the fight to a swift and peaceful conclusion.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jingbo</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A committed Air Acolyte looking to help in whatever way he can <span class="p">Jingbo is an eager Air Acolyte who wants to help the Avatar through thoughtful dedication. He struggles with certain aspects of Air Nomad traditions, namely meditation, but his commit- ment to the Acolytes is steadfast. Though he isn’t a bender, Jing- bo doesn’t hesitate to enter a dangerous situation if it means he can protect others or defend Air Nomad ideals. He also doesn’t mind taking on more mundane tasks, such as carrying supplies, and is happy to participate as an Acolyte in any way possible.</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jingbo’s earnest enthusiasm can provide aspiring Acolytes with insight into the less romantic truths of being an Acolyte and help people differentiate between the fantasy and reality of joining.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yee-Li</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Air Acolyte keeping tradition alive</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yee-Li is one of the founding members of the Ba Sing Se chapter of the Avatar Aang Fan Club. One of the original Air Acolytes, she is so dedicated to keeping Air Nomad tradition alive that Toph, one of Aang’s closest allies, has accused her of focusing too much on the past. Toph’s criticism has not deterred Yee-Li, however.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
<a href="part37.htm#bookmark93" class="s25">Yee-Li is particularly fond of Air Nomad music, and she plays the cymbals when the Acolytes play together. Interestingly, Yee-Li has a soft spot for The Dark One (page 74),</a> one of Toph’s first</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">metalbending students, even though her personality is much more cheerful and his is more brooding. If heroes need to take on a particularly daunting task, Yee-Li might be able to get both the Air Acolytes and the Beifong Metalbenders on their side.</p>

<p class="s10" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Threats and Challenges</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reviving Air Nomad Culture</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Finding What Was Lost</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes have a challenging task in learning and preserv- ing Air Nomad culture, and not just because they have only one living Air Nomad to learn from. So much that belonged to the Air Nomads was destroyed during the Hundred Year War. This makes every relic and piece of documentation especially pre- cious now. Much of what survived in the war was stolen, often by the Fire Nation. In addition to recovering the physical pieces of Air Nomad history, the Air Acolytes do their best to memorize how holidays are celebrated, stories told, and rituals conducted, so that they don’t have to rely on Aang to give them instructions.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Appropriation vs. Appreciation</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Growing Pains</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s not always clear where the line is between preserving Air Nomad culture and appropriating it in a disrespectful way. For instance, Airbender tattoos can only be earned through years of mastering airbending forms and Air Nomad philosophy. Though Avatar Aang believes that the Acolytes have the hearts of Air Nomads, there are still lines that shouldn’t be crossed. Figuring out those lines and being willing to learn from mistakes is all a part of the Air Acolytes’ mission. Heroes may need to contend with aspiring Acolytes who don’t care about these boundaries, especially if they cause problems by pretending to be experts on all things Air Nomad.</p>
<p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maintaining Balance with Spirits</p>
<p class="s40" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linked theme: Coexistence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Acolytes already had their first run-in with the Spirit World when the Earthen Fire Refinery provoked the ire of the ancient spirit General Old Iron (featured in <i>The Rift </i>comic series). The Acolytes are quickly learning that making peace with spirits is a big part of what the Air Nomads did, and now they share that responsibility. They must not only consider the agreements that Avatar Yangchen made with spirits long ago, but how to help the Avatar when he seeks to foster balance between humans and spirits. And if they can’t reach Aang in a crisis, hopefully the Acolytes have learned enough from him to act!</p>
